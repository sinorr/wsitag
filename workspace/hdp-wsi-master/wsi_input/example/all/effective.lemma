Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
This year , the spirit of National Economy Work Conference should be carried through and implemented , while deepening State-owned enterprise reform and continuing to reinforce restructuring , striving to increase effective demands , improving supply quality , promoting the healthy and steady development of an industrial economy .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .  
Zhang Qiong , deputy procurator-general , when briefing reporters on related situations , emphasized that to reform the procuratorial work and strengthen the function and role of legal supervision , it is necessary to gradually set up a coordinated investigation mechanism , where the procuratorial organs across the country support , coordinate with , and assist each other ; to build in the Supreme People 's Procuratorate and all provincial-level procuratorates an investigation commanding center featured by unhindered acquisition of information , acute response , and effective commanding ability and a " personnel bank " of backbone investigators ;  
establish an education structure that is compatible with the socialist market economic structure and the inherent law of education and that integrates different types of education .  This will create an unprecedentedly relaxed macroenvironment and effective condition for the implementation of policies and measures designed to provide opportunities for those leaving schools to pursue advanced studies and for " burden reduction . "  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
However , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .  Inadequate effective demand and contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure are still very prominent , and no new consumption hot spots are on the horizon .  Problems in our economic life accumulated over the years have all cropped up and the international market still has many uncertain factors - - we should place adequate importance on these problems .  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
We must keep a sober mind on this issue .  The leading comrades of the State Council have stressed the need for many times to make a proper use of the practice of " changing debt into equity , " for it is an effective means for us to assist key state enterprises with well-marketable products , a sound management foundation , and a broad development prospect to lower their liabilities ratio and to turn their deficits into profits .  
Strengthening the study of the creative professions , the study and discussion of works , commentaries on literary and artistic works and focusing on the association of professional and amateur creative works are also effective ways to improve the quality of creative works and offer more excellent works .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .  They should also establish effective mechanisms to ban the practice of journalists getting personal gains in the guise of making journalistic reports so as to truly fundamentally separate news-covering , editing , and reporting activities from commercial activities .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
The third is to make clear the guiding ideology that the examination , verification and issuance of certificates are only one link of management and are not the entire management of social order and fire prevention .  What is more important is to establish a standard and effective routine supervision and inspection mechanism in order to ensure that once a problem is discovered , it will be dealt with until it is solved and thorough improvements are made .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
Structural readjustment of enterprises means to concentrate effective resources through the market on the industries that concern the state 's economic lifeline and whose scale merit is particularly evident to enable them to establish an appropriate scale of production and operation , so that they will become important industries of the national economy , the pillars of the essential areas , the leaders in economic restructuring , the representatives to international competition , and the leading forces in the state 's regulation and control of the state .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
In particular , the construction of command automation has been implemented for a long time in a random and isolated manner without effective mutual access and mutual exchange between different forces , which has seriously impeded the whole system from giving full play to its mass effectiveness and powerfulness and which can not meet the requirements for battle under high-tech conditions . 
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
The functional transfer of the pension payer , from enterprises to social institutions , which serves to ensure a timely and accurate payment of pensions to retirees , is an important and effective measure for the purpose of implementing the " three represents " theory of President Jiang Zemin , practically ensuring the basic life demands and rights of the masses of enterprises retirees as well as supporting the reform of state owned enterprises by alleviating their burden of social duties .  
The meticulous strategic setup that the United States worked out in Russia 's neighboring countries was not only designed to squeeze Russia 's strategic space but also to set up in advance an effective strategic support platform to interfere in the Euro-Asian region affairs in future .  
That is , with information as the leading factor , attention is paid to laterally renovating or improving the existing system of weapons so that they will be universally applicable and there will be a linkage between them .  This will facilitate accurate access , timely transmission and effective process and use of information , enhance the combined force of attack of the firepower system , thereby raising the overall efficiency of the weaponry and combat system .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
We should further strengthen a sense of anxiety , of urgency and of mission and put into full play an excellent working style of making full use of every minute , work in a sweeping and resolute manner , do work right after we say we will do it and try to do work well .  We should thoroughly eradicate unhealthy , formalistic , deceptive working styles that waste time and should devote solid and effective efforts to implement all aspects of work .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
Supervision and management should be strengthened and landmark projects for technological transformation should be accomplished as scheduled .  Technological transformation must center on variety , quality , efficiency , and expansion of export .  High and new technology and advanced , applicable technology should be used to transform a batch of key enterprises in the important industries to develop products that enjoy competitive advantages and to stem redundant development in an effective way .  
Due to the prompt action taken in education and effective measures implemented , everyone maintained a healthy psychological attitude on the scientific knowledge in highland .  While not fearing the highland , they adopted a serious attitude to counter the problems on highland .  
Blair has pointed out at US hearings on numerous occasions that the west Pacific situation does not make one optimistic , and the US forces in the Pacific must therefore be prepared for the worst , and one of the most elementary steps they should take is to deploy cruise missiles on Guam , so that US military response in the west Pacific can be faster and more effective .  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with . 
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
It is a pressing and important task with high requirements to conduct admonitory education with the serious cases of Cheng Kejie and Hu Changqing . Party committees at all levels must take admonitory education as a major political task , and fulfill this task by doing intensive and effective work with a strong sense of political responsibility , sufficient energy for exercising leadership , and a soaring morale and healthy mentality , thus guaranteeing that admonitory education achieve expected solid results .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
In order for command posts to become more efficient in organization and command in field operations , our department has made new trials .  We have designated pilot units for improving command in field operations , explored command equipment , optimized command groups , made command materials , improved command methods , developed command software , and trained command personnel .  This has made command organs combat effective ahead of the military units .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
At present , the people throughout the province have a strong desire and high enthusiasm for making progress and speeding up economic and social development .  We ardently hope to seize the historic opportunity brought about by the state 's strategic decision on making the great development of the western areas to effective fast economic development .  
Not long ago , the unit staged a training exercise aimed at providing support for a motorized division .  Despite repeated air strikes launched by an " enemy , " the unit managed to mount a counterattack with various effective tactics against the " enemy " amidst air strikes and fully fulfilled its task of supporting sea transportation , thus attaining such a goal as " mobilized defense " coupled with " mobilized counter-attack " and tempering its wartime mobility in an all-round way .  
On the one hand , when the Russian planes suddenly entered the defense zone , the aircraft carrier 's onboard could be subjected to electronic interference from the Russian fighters which made the target display indistinct ; on the other hand , personnel manning the radar could be overly negligent , overlook the suspicious target , did away with effective tracking and monitoring , which enabled the Russian planes to fly extremely low when coming near the aircraft carrier and entered the radar 's blind spot .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
With the deepening of the reform of naval training in recent years , the trend of training troops by high-tech means is advancing with the force of gusty winds and surging waves .  New types of warships and combat planes that were included into the battle array during the Ninth Five-Year Plan have basically become combat effective .  The Navy has put great emphasis on operational and combined-arms tactical training for combined operations .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
It has been proved through practice that the military school activities for young people developed in elementary schools and junior middle schools and the military training activities developed in high schools and universities are effective means for conducting national defense education for the youngsters ; therefore , the activities have won common recognition from the students , parents , schools , and society .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
In order to welcome a new revolution in agro-technology , the National Agro-Technology Conference set a well-founded and effective management system for agro-technology , a system of research and development of an advanced international standard , a visionary promotion and service system for agro-technology , and a strong and stable guarantee system for agro-technology , created a new system for agro-technology which is congruent with the socialist market economy system , and established new mechanisms for development , distribution , competitiveness , and cooperation .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
Hong Kong holds a very favorable geographical position in the Asia-Pacific region .  While facing such an important business opportunity at present , if we neglected effective operation , become less insensitive to changes in surrounding areas , and weaken the commercial and trade activities , then Hong Kong 's economic strength will not be able to display its prominent role and Hong Kong may gradually decline in the tides of the times .  
Zheng Ming stressed in the aforementioned exclusive interview with the magazine : China must strengthen the maritime awareness of the entire nation .  At the same time , it must also establish a correct and effective ocean strategy , and bring about an all-round and high-speed development to its maritime economy .  Only in this way will China be able to deal with increasingly grim challenges of all kinds in the future .  
While entering into the new historical era , Chairman Jiang showed great foresight and stood on the high altitude of strategy and overall situation to have put forth the general requirements of five phrases of " being up to standard in politics , perfect in mastering military skills , excellent in work styles , highly disciplined , and effective in safeguard " , which has clearly pointed out the forward direction for strengthening the all-round grass-roots building .  
If we further analyze the reason why the effective running of the Western congressional system is commensurate with the social conditions of social pluralism in the West , we will find that multiparty politics goes in line with the pluralistic state of aggregate public opinion distribution .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
Because of all this , it has become a top priority for the Chinese in the post-Deng era to diligent pursue the establishment of effective supervision mechanisms suited for China 's national conditions and to promote democratic system innovation in a situation of relative political stability , so as to prevent China from being trapped in endemic corruption and an " emergency room paradox " resulting from the dilemma created by the contradictions . 
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
According to the principle of state responsibility stated in international law , the US Government must apologize to the Chinese Government and people , stop immediately all its reconnaissance activities along the coastal areas of China , actively cooperate with the Chinese Government to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of this incident , and compensate in a rapid , complete , and effective manner for the personnel and property losses on the part of the Chinese side .  
He said , through thejoint efforts of the international community , effective international rulesshould be drawn up on the basis of full participation and democraticconsultation by all countries , to ensure that globalization can help to narrowthe disparities between north and south and between rich and poor , help topromote common development , help the developing countries to benefit fromglobalization , and help to promote balanced , steady , and sustainable worldeconomic development .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further advance the reform of the administrative system , further separate the administrative functionality of the government institutions from enterprises and effectively transform the administration functions so that the economic management functionality of the government will really be focused on supervising the market operation and keeping the market order , and the government will establish and perfect a set of effective mechanisms and systems for keeping and supervising the order of the market economy .  
All localities and all departments must keep a strong sense of political responsibility and the spirit of being highly responsible to the interests of the people , carefully organize their actions according to the unified arrangements of the central leadership , take effective measures and achieve solid results in restoring a regular and orderly condition of the market so that the people can be satisfied and can set their minds at rest .  
The responsibility of the incident completely lies on the US side .  The Chinese Government filed a protest and made solemn representations to the US Government over the US act violating international law , encroaching on China 's airspace and sovereignty , and compromising China 's national security and interests , demanding that the United States undertake full responsibility for the incident , apologize to the Chinese people , and take practical and effective measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents .  
Zhang Qiyue said : The US plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane , resulting in the missing of a Chinese pilot , intruded into China 's airspace , and landed at a Chinese airfield without permission .  The incident has not fully concluded .  The Chinese side asks the US side to provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people , stop sending its airplanes to conduct reconnaissance activities above the Chinese coast , and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
It is especially necessary to take effective policy measures to build and develop a contingent of high-level personnel and versatile personnel who can meet the needs of the new period , with the focus on training and absorbing capable personnel for making innovations , management and operation and on further creating a favorable environment for capable personnel who have returned from studying abroad to do pioneering work .

These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores .

Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective .

In the light of the urgency of the need to find timely and effective approaches for addressing the issue , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria , Greece , Moldova , Romania and Ukraine came forward with a set of specific proposals in a joint letter to the Secretary-General of 18 May 1995 , circulated as an official United Nations document ( A / 50 / 189 ) .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for a concerted response from the international community to deal in a more effective manner with the special economic problems of the affected States , I would like to introduce the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 32 , entitled Economic assistance to States affected by the implementation of the Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
As further stated in the Secretary-General 's report in document A / 50 / 526 , on early warning capacities of the United Nations system , the value of a timely and effective warning system to avert losses and to protect resources is essential , particularly as countries begin to incorporate disaster-reduction policies into their social and economic development plans .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
Indonesia , along with the other non-aligned countries , has consistently emphasized that if the United Nations is to become a fully effective central instrument in a new and revitalized international order , reflecting the new realities of the international situation , it should be based on and truly reflect the democratic spirit of equality , equity and transparency , in representation as well as in the decision-making processes .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
This requires concerted action to ensure a consistent and incremental flow of resources , effective participation by African countries in international trade and a strategy to resolve the crushing debt problem faced by the continent .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
It is precisely in these areas that both Organizations have accumulated an inspiring operational capacity , expertise and legal basis that , if rationally combined and divided between them , would make it possible to substantially improve work done in the search for effective responses to international challenges .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
One representative raised the question of whether the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was sufficiently effective to safeguard individual women against gender discrimination and called for the endorsement of the proposal for an optional protocol , as agreed upon at the European regional preparatory meeting .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities , which include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values , taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
An effective consultative process should be established and implemented with concerned groups of society where the formulation and decision-making of all components of the programmes are based on a nationwide consultative process drawing on community meetings , regional workshops and national seminars , as appropriate .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities that include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values and taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
An effective advisory service and technical assistance programme was a major concern of all those who took part in the World Conference on Human Rights , Governments , United Nations agencies and programmes , regional and national institutions and non-governmental organizations alike , and the Vienna Declaration makes such a programme one of the principal means for achieving its objectives and those of the Programme of Action .  
In addition , the Declaration stated that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development required effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
Aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace in Central America , and bearing in mind that the Central American Integration System constitutes the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development can be promoted in an effective , orderly and coherent manner ,  
Since the completion of the previous report , the Special Rapporteur has received information of more instances of the judicial system failing to take effective measures to identify and punish those responsible for crimes and to provide families and relatives of Serbian victims with proper legal responses to the death or disappearance of their relatives .  
In introducing the report , the representative pointed out that the priorities set out in the White Paper to the Parliament ( Storting ) in the spring of 1993 included an active child-care policy with a focus on shared family responsibilities between the parents , renewed efforts to reach the goal of equal pay , and more effective actions against the abuse of women and sexual violence .  
The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market .

Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;

With reference to the Ombud 's call for a more effective affirmative action policy , she said that the view of the previous gender equality Ombud , as presented in Norway 's third periodic report , had been that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened , in order to make them fully effective , or abolished altogether , since existing arrangements gave the general public a quite unrealistic idea of women 's chances in the labour market .  
There was a need to continue the search for more effective measures to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of which posed a threat to peace and international security , especially given the growing number of regional and internal conflicts .  
Mr . KISLYAK ( Russian Federation ) said that the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an international event of paramount importance in terms of the achievement of strategic stability .  The main task of the Conference was to reach a decision on the extension of the Treaty , inasmuch as all States - large and small , nuclear and non-nuclear alike - needed the Treaty and the Treaty 's effective operation must continue in the future .  
Nuclear establishments and the transport of nuclear material required appropriate physical protection , and States needed to have effective border controls so that they had control over what left their territory and were able to carry out their non-proliferation obligations not to permit sensitive nuclear materials to be transmitted to non-peaceful programmes or to terrorist groups .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
The Committee recognized that for the non-governmental groups to be organized , including through national or regional coalitions , and to be in a position to provide expert advice , it would be essential to ensure that they have effective access to the Committee 's agenda and to the time-limit established for the submission of written information .  
By the same resolution , the Security Council decided that the Mission be established for a period up to six months , subject to the proviso that it would continue beyond 6 February 1995 only if the Secretary-General reported to the Council by that date that the parties had agreed to extend the agreement of 17 September 1994 , and that they remained committed to an effective cease-fire , national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy . 
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .

Both the resident coordinator and agency representatives will be held accountable by their respective organizations for the effective and coherent functioning of the system at the country level .  
In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice , as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility which are not against the law , and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
With regard to item 114 ( b ) of the draft agenda ( Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ) , the Secretary-General wishes to recall resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 whereby the General Assembly , inter alia , decided to mark the end of the United Nations Year for Tolerance at a special commemorative plenary meeting of its fiftieth session .  
Work actively , where necessary , to find additional ways and means for the effective protection and use of such knowledge , innovations and practices , subject to national legislation and consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity and relevant international law , encourage fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
This agreement appears to be founded on the understanding that the problem is equally threatening for all countries of the world , and that those countries having difficulties in bringing their relevant mechanisms up to the required standard for effective action in preventing and controlling its effects will be assisted by those in a position to do so .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
In view of the replies sent to him by Governments , the Special Rapporteur felt that decisive steps should be taken at the international level to establish effective administrative and legal remedies which victims of intolerance or discrimination based on religion could avail themselves of in cases of violations of the rights set forth in the Declaration .  
In the Code of Conduct , the collective membership of SACB also agreed that international assistance to Somalia is founded on the basic principle that responsibility for its effective execution shall remain with the Somali people and that responsible Somali authorities are therefore expected to assume their proper role to ensure that conditions exist for the effective implementation of aid activities .  
A key component of its work is to see to it that national institutions play an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
Beyond the ensuing moderate improvement in its staffing situation , OIOS understood this decision as a significant and encouraging endorsement of its efforts to make internal oversight an effective , credible and independent component of the management structure of the United Nations . 
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
NULLAs countries incorporate disaster-reduction policies into their national social and economic development plans , establish effective preparedness measures and improve their response capacities , the value of timely and effective warnings in averting losses and protecting resources becomes apparent .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
NULLAlthough no complaints were received about violations directly linked to trade union activities during the period in question , complaints continued to be received of violations of the right to swift and effective justice , involving leaders or workers who were subjected to threats , dismissed or subjected to reprisals because they organized themselves into trade unions or asserted their interests as workers .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
In the aforesaid resolution , the General Assembly enumerated the High Commissioner 's responsibilities , which basically involve promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .

It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
Even the most rigorous and effective programmes of domestic economic stabilization and structural adjustment would leave those countries with serious obstacles to moving to a sustained and sustainable development path .  
The Secretary-General supports this approach , which should be aimed at enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the United Nations in the performance of its functions and its ability to address the most urgent tasks and new demands , as well as to ensure an efficient and effective United Nations system capable of dealing with the growing number of global challenges in the economic , social and related fields . 
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
64 A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .  
Reaffirming its resolution 48 / 165 of 21 December 1993 on the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership and 48 / 166 of 21 December 1993 on an agenda for development , Reaffirming also the urgent need for a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,

The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
While the Working Group is convinced that a strengthening of international cooperation and solidarity is essential for universal realization of the right to development , it is aware than there are major weaknesses in the ability of the United Nations system to make this cooperation effective and sufficiently strong to solve the acute problems currently facing the international community .

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
those organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations , scientific associations and non-governmental organizations which , in accordance with decisions of their governing bodies , have incorporated the recommendations of the General Assembly relating to disaster reduction and those of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction in their programmes of work , thus contributing towards effective progress in disaster reduction in their mandated responsibilities and respective fields of activity , including the allocation of budgetary resources for disaster reduction ,  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Looks forward to the finalization of the interim report of the independent expert on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 7 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session ;  
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 23 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 22 September 1995 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled : " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 , of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
asks the United Nations Security Council to ensure the full implementation of that agreement by adopting a feasible mandate based on the establishment of an effective provisional administration and the deployment of a credible international force equipped with sufficient resources .  
I have recently intensified my personal contacts with the heads of the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization , as well as with other executive heads .  A key objective of these consultations , and of ongoing discussions in ACC , is to ensure that these processes build on each other and result in a more effective and coherent United Nations system .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
There is need for further systematic and progressive effort in order to achieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
As we seek to enhance the relevance of this Organization to the world today , it is imperative that we understand that the vast majority of the people of this world expect the United Nations to be a principal actor for progress and change , and to be equipped to play an effective and leading role in improving the economic and social situation of the world 's citizens .  
In closing , let me say that my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you , Sir , and all other members over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative , effective and united United Nations for the twenty-first century .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
While drawing the international community 's attention to the irrelevant linkage between the implementation of the aforementioned resolution and recent events in northern Iraq , and to the humanitarian appeals inside the country , we call on Iraq to cooperate fully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees the effective and swift implementation of this resolution .  
While actively supporting the Commission , the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts alone can not guarantee equitable security in the region if they are not paired with other effective and practical measures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there and to promote comprehensive and unconditional acceptance of international monitoring and inspection of all activities related to this matter .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Considering the late stage of our work , and given the importance that my delegation attached to the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the work of the Preparatory Commission in this regard , and in the spirit of cooperation , we decided not to insist on our original proposal on the work of the Preparatory Commission and agreed to language that was incorporated in A / C . 1 / 51 / L . 48 / Rev . 1 as a new operative paragraph 6 .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Nile basin : Through the effective development of an operational remote sensing capacity to receive Meteosat satellite imagery for the Blue and White Nile data , Meteosat derived rainfall information is calibrated and fed into forecasting models to provide up to three weeks ' advance notice of river flow at critical points along the Blue Nile ;  
Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice , as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility which are not against the law , and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant . "

Information , education and communication strategies that employ a multi-channel approach have proved effective , since information can be disseminated through various channels , traditional and modern , and can be packaged in various forms so as to allow both literate and illiterate audiences to understand key messages .  
Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts , to diminish tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments ,  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 9 / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Her delegation was convinced that , in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Platform for Action , specific and positive policies must be formulated and applied at the national level .  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .

Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
The ideal is complementarity ; as stated in one of the NFAP operating principles , by complementing and reinforcing existing and planned national and international initiatives , NFAPs will contribute to effective , comprehensive and coordinated action .  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
LAMAMRA ( Algeria ) said that an independent and effective international jurisdiction must be established which would enjoy unquestioned moral authority and whose actions would be guided solely by the rule of law , far removed from the political influences that could pervert it .

First , a modern , fair and transparent personnel policy , in which placement and promotion played an important part , and the strict implementation of that policy were crucial determinants of the effective future performance of the Organization . The General Assembly , in resolution 47 / 226 , had urged the Secretary-General to improve all personnel policies , yet that requirement had still not been implemented .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems .

Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;

Bearing in mind that the objective of those programmes is to develop within each country a national mechanism to manage and execute an integrated programme of mine clearance and that , as a consequence of armed conflicts , the affected countries are facing considerable economic constraints , only the effective contribution of the international community can enable us gradually to overcome the serious problems caused by existing landmines .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,

This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
A key element of an effective arms control regime is provision for complete , accurate and timely exchange of relevant information , including the size , structure , location and military doctrine of military forces as well as their activities ; - Verification .

In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;

If democratization is the most reliable way to legitimize and improve national governance , it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization , making it more open and responsive by increasing participation , more efficient by allowing for burden-sharing and more effective by allowing for comparative advantage and greater creativity .  
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .

The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Through its promotional activities , UNHCR sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , and to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to the Office , including by means of their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries that have not yet done so to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;

The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU requires for its continued success an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations , responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members , the developing countries .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
The speedy commencement and rapid conclusion of good-faith negotiations to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice , is of paramount importance to the future of the international community .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures , such as , inter alia , arms control , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , confidence-building measures , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants , demining and conversion , often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective rehabilitation and social and economic development ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
As part of the follow-up to the Social Summit , Governments have reported a variety of actions towards the eradication of poverty : adopting national targets for poverty reduction ; promoting job creation and growth ; maintaining effective safety nets , including comprehensive social security , universal health care and education services ; providing adequate housing ; enhancing social integration of the poor ; and undertaking studies and surveys to improve national information on poverty .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
Improving these pragmatic arrangements appears to be less costly and more effective for the time being than undertaking a radical reform of common services , unless convincing proof is offered to the contrary .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the member countries of the European Union are fully committed to this goal and that the United Nations General Assembly , with 150 votes in favour and none against , adopted last fall a resolution in which urgent and vigorous measures for the conclusion of an effective , legally binding international agreement leading to a comprehensive ban on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of APLMs are called for .  
After briefly reviewing the achievements of UNCED and continuing impediments to sustainable development , the present report identifies a way forward that includes fiscally responsible government actions , more effective economic incentives , improvement in the enabling conditions for change , and other market-oriented policies designed to optimize sustainable development in the areas of energy , water and transportation , while building in a concern for social equity .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
The Committee shall not declare a communication admissible unless it has ascertained that all available [ legal ] domestic remedies have been exhausted [ in accordance with generally recognized rules of international law ] ; [ this shall not apply where the Committee considers the application of the remedies to be [ unreasonably prolonged ] [ unreasonable ] or unlikely to bring effective relief ] [ unless the claimant demonstrates that such remedies are ineffective or that the application of the remedies has been unduly prolonged ] ; 
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining its multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at the universal and effective respect of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
Several resident coordinators believe that a more effective collaboration in country operations should be encouraged both by Bretton Woods institutions and the United Nations system organizations at headquarters level , while another group of resident coordinators suggests that the Bretton Woods institutions be associated in the joint programming consultation of the United Nations system , through common participation in periodic meetings on programming and coordination , and regular consultation on planning and strategy issues .  
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
The deliberations of the three committees confirmed once again how the parallel developments in cartographic and in information technology were rapidly bringing to users cost-effective applications in surveying , charting and mapping as a comprehensive set of the tools and effective approaches required to meet the challenge of sustainable development and the priorities of the countries in the region .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
In the absence of a purposeful government programme of national reconciliation and effective police security throughout Croatia , UNHCR and UNTAES agree that all potential returnees should be encouraged to use the operational procedures to be assured of their full rights to reconstruction assistance , social benefits and security .  
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 45 / 179 of 21 December 1990 , by which the Assembly established the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the single body with the exclusive responsibility for coordinating all drug control activities within the United Nations system and for providing effective leadership in promoting international cooperation in drug control , thereby producing a catalytic impact on other international and national bodies ,  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The Government with its various structures has found itself unable to ensure systemwide and effective management of the economic and social processes and proper implementation of the reforms ; its has displayed poor initiative and spent its time largely " putting out fires " .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
Parts are considered equivalent to one piece when a suitable method of glued assembly is used as for instance Lindermann joint , tongue and groove joint , ship lap or rabbet joint ; or butt joint with at least two corrugated metal fasteners at each joint , or when other methods at least equally effective are used . 
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
The international community has learned that the most pressing developmental issues facing today 's world - poverty and social development , population , governance , gender equality , environment - transcend both sectoral and national boundaries , and effective responses must be multidimensional and global .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
This duty is impaired when institutions fail to comply with their legal obligation to provide , in a timely manner , for appropriate means of guaranteeing full respect for human rights or of carrying out prompt , exhaustive and effective investigations when such rights are violated .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
A key component of its work is to assist national institutions in playing an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and to forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
He indicated that in support of the devolution of responsibility to the most effective managerial level , in some carefully defined areas , consolidation provided considerable cost saving and other administrative benefits and could also result in more effective services , including those provided through the establishment of a common services facility , an area in which work was already proceeding . 
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
That finding by the special session was echoed by the International Court of Justice , which concluded in its epoch-making Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 which should be a constant reminder , particularly to nuclear-weapon States that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control . 
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
5 ) . the Secretary-General further stated that he " is therefore obliged to point out that unless Member States take early and effective action to reverse this trend , there will be no alternative to suspending even the reduced functions performed locally by the centres and closing their offices in the three capitals concerned " . 
We express the hope that joint efforts will be successful and effective and that international personnel will receive from the Tajik people adequate support and hospitality , and will thus be able vigorously and fully to discharge the broad range of responsible and important tasks included in the updated UNMOT mandate .  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Calls upon all States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and support efforts within the United Nations system to adopt effective measures concerning the fulfilment of the right of the child to an adequate standard of living and the continuous and progressive improvement of living and housing conditions as stipulated in the relevant international agreements and conventions ;  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Almost two years ago , the International Court of Justice , in a historic Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , unanimously concluded that States parties to the NPT have the obligation not only to begin but also to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
The historical stance of Ecuador , a peace-loving country , has led it to reaffirm that the general and complete disarmament process , under effective international control , must move forward with firm steps , responding to the legal and moral conscience of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , which are pioneers in this area , as evidenced by the Treaty of Tlatelolco . 
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;

The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
At its fifty _ second session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1996 / 15 , reaffirmed that the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development required perseverance and concrete efforts and that that dynamic process should be pursued at all appropriate levels , including through the elaboration of international and national strategies , which required the effective contribution of States , organs and organizations of the United Nations system and of non-governmental organizations active in that field .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .

It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;

In the United States , the Department of Justice is engaged in an ongoing initiative to establish effective and productive working relationships between the federal Government and state governments and local governmental subdivisions .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .

On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
ITC and UNCTAD have anticipated this trend , and our cooperation in the area of trade efficiency has been the sine qua non for the effective contribution we have been able to make in a practical , result _ oriented and business _ like fashion for making international trade transactions more efficient , less costly , and therefore more affordable to developing countries and their enterprises .  
Together with the Department of Administration and Management , the Office has embarked upon an effort to simplify programme monitoring and evaluation , including reporting to legislative bodies , with a view to transforming it from what is perceived as a cumbersome procedure of mere quantitative reporting to oversight bodies into a meaningful and effective tool for managers to review the performance of the function for which they are responsible .

However , the Inspectors considered that examination of the issues in the report was timely since they believed that a modern , fair , and transparent personnel policy , of which placement and promotion were an important part , and its strict implementation , were crucial determinants of effective future performance of the United Nations .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;

Since 1968 , one of the Government 's priorities has been to put an end to all the manifestations of administrative corruption , which were widespread during previous eras , through the promulgation of numerous decrees and the adoption of effective measures to enable the Iraqi people to enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights .  
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .

Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
In order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation in the area of juvenile justice , the Committee transmits , as it may consider appropriate , to specialized agencies , UNICEF and other competent bodies any reports from States parties that contain a request , or indicate a need , for advisory services and technical assistance , along with observations and suggestions of the Committee , if any , on those requests or indications ( in accordance with article 45 ( b ) of the Convention ) .

On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .

The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;

Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;

Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .

With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;

The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } promotional activities sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , as well as to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to UNHCR , including through their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
To that end , the focus of the subprogramme will be on the role of the Organization in furthering economic and social development , democracy and human rights and peace and security , and enhancing the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of meeting the challenges posed in a rapidly changing international environment .  
The central thrust of the subprogramme is the promotion of the Convention and the related agreements by facilitating their understanding , their widest possible acceptance , their uniform and consistent application and their effective implementation , as well as assisting States in their efforts to derive full practical benefits from the international legal regime , and in the enjoyment of their rights and the fulfilment of their obligations arising therefrom .  
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
The establishment of a workable and effective system of cooperation between the court and States was of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the court , and the statute should contain explicit provisions on the matter that drew on existing structures and practice in international judicial cooperation .  
Thus , it supported General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 S , a logical stance fully consistent with the joint action of the European Union , which is committed to the goal of the total elimination of anti _ personnel landmines and shall work actively towards the achievement at the earliest possible date of an effective international agreement to ban these weapons worldwide .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
To this end , recognizing the need for the gradual formation and development of a common economic area through the creation of conditions for the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour , the Parties shall take effective measures to coordinate a strategy for carrying out economic reforms , deepening economic integration on the basis of mutual advantage and harmonizing their economic legislation .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "

In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .

Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
In its second Advisory Opinion , the Inter-American Court stated that the ' essential ' judicial guarantees that are not subject to derogation according to article 27 include habeas corpus , amparo , and any other effective remedy before judges or competent tribunals which is designed to guarantee respect for the rights and freedoms whose suspension are not authorized by the American Convention .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development , as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , where stress is laid on the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which promotes partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aimed at universal and effective observance of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
A view widely shared by Governments was that the formulation of effective recommendations for action had to be based on a solid understanding of the various aspects of international migration and development , and on reliable information regarding the multifaceted experience of the countries involved in the international migration process .  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
Furthermore , since international cooperation would have to be strengthened , as the Secretary-General had stated in his report ( A / 51 / 309 ) , the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949 , to which fewer than half of the Member States were party , should be revised and a new body established with responsibility for examining reports on the implementation of that Convention , in order to make it more effective .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
What was needed was an innovative , effective and lasting approach , based on a common set of principles for future debt negotiations , which would include arrangements for a substantial reduction of all categories of debt .  
Nicaragua believed that , in an increasingly interdependent world , a permanent , effective , flexible and lasting solution must be found to the debt problem , and that solution must be geared towards economic and social development .  
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
Competition authorities could make a key contribution in the formulation and implementation of economic policies by ( a ) expressing their views relating to policies or measures that restrict competition , and advising on how legitimate economic goals might be attained through less competition _ restricting measures ; and ( b ) combining effective enforcement against RBPs with an economically realistic approach to cooperation and concentration and a dynamic assessment of markets .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent and representative , and it should influence both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners , and it must occur at all appropriate levels of government .  
Other critical factors needed for effective dialogue include : ensuring the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture in developing countries in general ; addressing ideological resistance to the transition from a command economy to a market economy ; and putting in place measures which foster the integration of informal sector enterprises into the formal sector of the economy .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings subject to the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 24 .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
At the end of the biennium , it is envisaged that in the key States parties to the memorandum of understanding , and in which national and subregional drug-control efforts are pursued , effective drug-control coordination and legislation will have taken hold , illicit opium poppy cultivation in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic , Myanmar and Viet Nam will be noticeably reduced , effective control measures against trafficking will be in place and prevention and reduction of drug abuse will have received more vigorous efforts by the national authorities and civil societies alike .  
National coordinating agencies will receive guidance and advice in mobilizing private-sector investment , conducting feasibility studies , developing marketing strategies , identifying effective credit schemes , organizing international round tables , negotiating debt swaps and assisting national authorities seeking extensions or enlargement of current international preferential trade arrangements for selected Andean exports . 
There is a need in international drug control for internationally accepted standards , methodological knowledge and tested and effective model approaches , all of which would contribute to make national and international drug control efforts more efficient and effective .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
We are also greatly alarmed to see an insecure and uncertain worldwide economic situation in which dubious speculative practices continue to wreak havoc in the absence of effective controls by those responsible .

Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
For the forest sector to become relatively more effective and influential and attract more resources , international and regional institutions and bilateral donors with coordination units at the national level would have to be engaged .

Although still in the development stage , the results-oriented annual reports ( ROARs ) have the potential of becoming an integral part of a viable framework for the future , one based on effective planning and execution and rooted in results-based management .  
We hope that this omission will not set a negative precedent in the future , because we consider such a provision to be necessary to guarantee the effective and independent functioning of the Organization , particularly with respect to a Mission that is expected to be financed mainly through voluntary contributions .  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .

An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .

This imbues the Courts current report with a special character , since this objective for the Decade of International Law coincides with the supreme objective behind the establishment of the International Court of Justice in 1946 : that the Court should be an effective , efficient judicial means for the peaceful settlement of disputes .

The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .

Even though we continue to be collectively and individually committed to finding a comprehensive solution that would make the Security Council more representative , effective and transparent , delegations are also getting exhausted and drained by the repetitiveness of the debate , as we run around in circles trying to square major differences .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
As one of the delegations that first introduced the issue at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 1979 , we are firmly committed to the goal of achieving a Council that is more democratic , transparent , effective , accountable and relevant to current global realities.Six years have elapsed since the inception of the Open-ended Working Group , and we now stand at the threshold of a new millennium .  
While , because of the provisions written into the Charter , it may not be possible to eliminate the veto , the General Assembly , after witnessing for more than half a century initiatives for peace and security being stifled time and again by the use of veto , can not be expected to create additional obstacles to the effective functioning of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security by adding to the number of veto-wielding countries .  
He added that while almost every agency and operational arm of the United Nations had a special programme devoted to Africa , and even though the Organization had spent generous amounts of its resources on the continent , the United Nations still needed to be more involved in Africa and play a more effective role , as it does elsewhere , without undue preconditions .

International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,

Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;

We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;

We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
With regard to the development and diffusion of biotechnology , it was emphasized that , while national level research and development efforts were critical in order to ensure , among other things , that local conditions were taken into account , knowledge-sharing through North-South and South-South partnership and networking and regional initiatives were crucial for effective transfer and diffusion of technology .  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The resolution stressed that there would be no renegotiation of the existing agreements contained therein ; it defined the organizational aspects of the preparatory body and the special session and stressed the need for the effective participation of all stakeholders according to modalities similar to those applied in Cairo .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
She urged the Secretariat to take early and effective measures for the recruitment , on a broad geographical basis , of the staff required to replace the gratis personnel , and also to incorporate into the phase-out plan detailed transitional arrangements with a view to minimizing the cost of the process .  
He was concerned that persons from the countries directly involved might be assigned to such posts , and believed that only persons from neutral countries should be assigned to the new civil affairs unit to ensure the efficient , effective and impartial functioning of the Mission .  
The objective of health policy is to correct the imbalances in the national health system and make health care provision more effective and equitable , taking account of the constraints on choice imposed by the repercussions of demographic pressure and changes , the roles of the participants , and the funding and administration mechanisms for the sector .  
Accordingly , Moroccos health policy addresses five main concerns : a ) more effective mobilization and use of resources ; b ) the building of a new relationship between the public and private sectors regarding health matters ; c ) streamlined management and regulation of the overall health care system ; d ) improved services with control of spending ; and e ) participation by local communities .  
Although there were average monthly vacancy rates of 4.9 per cent for international staff and 6.9 per cent for local staff ( see annex III to the present report ) , additional requirements under local staff salaries and common staff costs were necessary due to the unforeseen retroactive increase of 12.5 per cent in local staff salaries effective from 1 January 1997 .  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
One important step would be the introduction of a comprehensive national legislation that removed major stumbling blocks and put into effect an efficient and effective policy for the applications of space technology in the development of the social and economic sectors .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , 25 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 2 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
In his report to the General Assembly ( A 53-355 , para . 22 ) , the independent expert on Haiti reported that over the past year , Haiti had begun facing the challenge of putting into place a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable and accessible justice system .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
Recalling the widely shared desire expressed during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly , held on 17 and 18 September 1998 , which constituted a renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , to continue discussions with a view to developing a coherent and effective response to the opportunities and challenges being offered by globalization and interdependence ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Our appeal has received further backing from the most prestigious international judicial institution , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which in its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 called on all States to pursue in good faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective control .  
As a result , the cause of nuclear disarmament has now made a qualitative leap forward , and is strengthened by the unanimous response of the Court that obligations exist to continue and complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all is aspects under strict and effective control .  
It was of paramount importance that the Court be truly independent , fair , effective and efficient , so that it could dispense justice in accordance with principles acceptable to the international community , bearing in mind diverse legal systems and cultures .  
He looked forward to the establishment of a permanent , independent , effective court , empowered to discharge specific tasks , yet not a substitute for national courts .  
In particular , he supported the creation of an effective , independent , impartial , efficient , universal international criminal court .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .  
Its composition and its relations with sovereign States and the United Nations would need the most careful consideration , in order to ensure that the Court would be permanent , effective , independent , efficient , credible and trustworthy .  
The community of nations had a fundamental interest in contributing to a more stable world by creating an international criminal court that was independent , effective and fair .  
An independent , effective and fair court must be perceived to be a judicial body guided by legal rather than political considerations .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
With regard to the above , there have not been sufficient efforts or effective measures by the Government to replace the authoritarian components of its system of organization with the elementary principles characteristic of any pluralist and democratic society , this being most apparent at the middle levels of the State and particularly in local administrations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
In light of this , what is most appropriate now , as Ethiopia has made known repeatedly , and what is called for , to reverse what Eritrea is determined to make imminent , is the application of effective and meaningful pressure on Eritrea in all areas - political , diplomatic and economic - to force it to see reason and to give peace a chance .  
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
When , at its fifty-second session , the Committee had been required to take a decision on paragraph 21 of the text that was to become resolution 52-118 , his delegation had drawn attention to the tendency to adopt resolutions that were political in nature on the methods of work of bodies which had been established pursuant to international instruments.If that trend continued , it might have an adverse impact on the effective implementation of the instruments .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The system of periodic reporting established within the context of all major international human rights instruments is the central element in monitoring full and effective national implementation of international human rights standards .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
While article 3 , paragraph 1 of the Declaration places upon States the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development , article 4 , paragraph 2 clearly states that effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
The Durban Declaration welcomed the growing interest shown worldwide in the establishment or strengthening of independent and pluralistic national institutions , particularly in Africa , and reaffirmed the important role that national institutions must play , both with regard to their responsibilities vis - - vis Governments and their responsibility to promote human rights and provide effective redress when those rights are violated .  
Parts are considered equivalent to one piece when a suitable method of glued assembly is used as for instance Lindermann joint , tongue and groove joint , ship lap or rabbet joint ; or butt joint with at least two corrugated metal fasteners at each joint , or when other methods at least equally effective are used . 6.6.4.5.3 Large packagings of plywood shall be at least 3 - ply . 
In the biennium 20002001 , the focus of the Executive Office will be on improving the provision of programme support in a more efficient and effective manner , both in the traditional areas of responsibility and in the additional aspects of human resources management that are expected to be decentralized and delegated from the central administration of the Secretariat to the Department .  
The international community can and must play a major and continuing role in supporting these efforts by working with the countries involved to promote reconciliation , broaden political participation , lay the groundwork for economic recovery and help build systems of justice that are fair , credible and effective . 
Requests the Secretary-General , in the further enhancement of the Organizations career development system , to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels ;  
Overall , the ECLAC secretariat is intent on continuing its devotion of major efforts towards the development of a more efficient and effective secretariat through cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training and improvement of horizontal and vertical communication among staff .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
The structure described above on a preliminary basis represents , in my judgement , the optimum for an effective and integrated international civil presence in Kosovo , which can fulfil the provisions of Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) with the assistance of relevant international organizations , under the leadership of the United Nations . Consultations are being undertaken with the organizations concerned to refine this concept further . 
I have the honour to refer to Economic and Social Council resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 in which the Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council at its substantive session of 1999 recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As you are aware , the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 , decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
The guidelines also lay emphasis on a number of principles , including the principle that effective verification can be undertaken without necessarily compromising national secrets , that it is important to protect sensitive national installations and information , that care should be taken to prevent the abuse of verification , and that the economic , technological and social development of States should not be jeopardized .  
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Mr . Lhdesmki ( Finland ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia , and , in addition , Iceland , said that the European Union had long supported the development of effective and responsive oversight , which was a critical tool for enhancing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations . 
To support and ensure effective follow-up to bilateral and multilateral initiatives , including regional and subregional consultation processes , where appropriate , to develop national policies and cooperative strategies to maximize the benefits and manage the challenges posed by international migration ;  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases ; and barrier methods , such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available , to prevent infection .  
Mobilizing and providing sufficient resources to meet the growing demand for access to information , counselling , services and follow-up on the widest possible range of safe , effective , affordable and acceptable family planning and contraceptive methods , including new options and underutilized methods ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
To take all effective measures to end all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary custody and receive prompt , just and fair trial under internationally recognized standards , and to investigate all reported acts of torture brought to its attention ;  
Emphasizing the fact that the realization of the right to development requires effective and efficient development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
An integrated , collaborative and coordinated approach to facilities policy , administrative and budgetary information exchange is being formulated to promote effective and efficient planning , management , maintenance and operation for all Headquarters and overseas physical facilities of the Organization .  
In contrast to the industry guidelines of a minimum of 2 per cent per annum and the recommended target rate of 3 per cent per annum , the effective annual rate for major maintenance expenditures on United Nations buildings listed in annex I owned not leased in the regular programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 was only . 88 per cent , based on the proposed biennium appropriation of $ 32.5-million .  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Calls upon Member States to promote cooperation between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
At the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council held in July 1999 Switzerland had stated that an effective coordination mechanism to promote the management of natural disasters should be established within the United Nations system as of the year 2000 . Such a structure should take account of the national and international dimensions of natural disasters .  
Calls for the speedy and effective implementation of the Beijing Platform of Action and the relevant provisions contained in the outcomes of all other major United Nations conferences and summits and , in this regard , expresses the hope that the special session of the General Assembly on questions and issues related to women scheduled for the year 2000 can take tangible and significant steps to enhance the effective participation of women in development ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
The Conference noted that two principal benefits that effective sharing of information would allow were ( a ) the ready retrieval of information on demonstration projects that could raise the awareness of decision makers ; and ( b ) the relative ease for countries in the region to carry out comparisons of operational agricultural methodologies in order to make decisions that would improve the effectiveness of their national programmes .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,

Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Urge States to design , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers who are victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and other related intolerance including , persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or be victims of illegal trafficking ;  
It was pointed out that the importance and urgency of work on insolvency law had been identified in a number of international organizations and there was wide agreement that more work was required in order to foster the development and adoption of effective national corporate insolvency regimes .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purpose of preparing a version of the revised draft elements of responsible crime prevention2 and proposing priorities for international action , including areas for technical assistance , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions , such as the office of a prime minister or president , or that responsible for economic management of development planning .  
Since the beginning of its existence as an independent nation , the Argentine Republic has demonstrated , through actions by the Government , the firm political determination to exercise its effective sovereignty in the southern territories and maritime areas inherited from Spain .  
The overall objective of improving public sector performance for the delivery of services in LDCs can only be accomplished through the creation of an enabling environment which will ensure effective resource utilization and partnership-building , promote effective society - wide participation and sustain the rule-of-law and equitable distribution of wealth .  
Political environment : It was broadly acknowledged that conflict prevention and resolution and good governance ( including a reliable , effective , and transparent legal and administrative system ) are indispensable elements for sustainable and people-centered development .  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 2 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
In this respect , it was felt that the role of the United Nations within the system would be effective to the extent that participatory approaches were pursued , and the United Nations built on its role as a forum where the competencies of different agencies could be drawn together and where their respective constituencies were engaged in a dialogue towards common , overriding objectives .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
This approach requires a comprehensive and holistic framework to articulate needs , and generate effective strategies and efficient policies , covering a broad range of interactive determinants , including demographic dynamics , social and economic conditions and natural resource endowments .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 7 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Noting that the effective functioning of national TCDC focal points and the full utilization of the TCDC modality , require , inter alia , adequate financial and human resources , as well as international support ,  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Underscores the need to ensure an effective role of the Special Unit for TCDC as the substantive secretariat of the High-level Committee and as the United Nations system coordinator for TCDC as well as the focal point in the United Nations system for South-South cooperation and to this effect , requests the Administrator of UNDP to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit within UNDP is maintained , and decides to periodically review the impact and functioning of the Special Unit in supporting , promoting and coordinating TCDC cooperation on a global and system-wide basis ;  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
Both these undertakings require an effective , trained and motivated workforce , operating within the confines of professionally managed establishments that are capable of undertaking major civil engineering work on an ongoing basis .  
First , it is unreasonable to believe that a clean and effective police force can be established when the majority of police officers , especially in Republika Srpska , are paid an irregular wage that is not sufficient for daily life .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
We resolve to promote increased and equal access for all people to open , efficient , effective and appropriate housing finance , to support savings mechanisms in the informal sector , where appropriate , and to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks and financial management capacity at all appropriate levels .  
In its resolution 1998 / 7 , the Sub-Commission decided to appoint Mr . Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at both the national and international levels , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means to reinforce activities in that field .  
The first-ever Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments , which was held at Headquarters from 30 August to 1 September 2000 , concluded with the adoption of the Declaration entitled The Parliamentary vision for international cooperation at the dawn of the third millennium , in which the Presiding Officers pledged their commitment to international cooperation with a strong United Nations at its core , and reaffirmed their belief that the United Nations should remain the cornerstone of effective global cooperation .  
Deeply concerned that the global HIV / AIDS epidemic , through its devastating scale and impact , constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity , as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights , which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society national , community , family and individual ;  
Acknowledging that prevention of HIV infection must be the mainstay of the national , regional and international response to the epidemic ; and that prevention , care , support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic ;  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
These harmful conflicts are breaking out and are becoming genuine threats to peace precisely at a time when what is required , more than ever , is coordinated and effective action by the international community , with all the necessary resources to address the very serious social and economic problems facing us .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To develop and implement , where possible , effective disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , including the effective collection , control , storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons , particularly in post-conflict situations , unless another form of disposition or use has been duly authorized , and such weapons have been marked and the alternate form of disposition or use has been recorded , and to include , where applicable , specific provisions for these programmes in peace agreements .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
Participants affirmed their commitment to providing the full financing and speedy and effective implementation of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) Initiative , which is essential for freeing domestic budgetary resources for poverty reduction , and they undertook to make expeditious progress towards full cancellation of outstanding official bilateral debt within the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative . 15 .  The Framework for Partnership ( A / CONF . 191 / 11 , chap .  
While least developed countries should assume ownership of designing and formulating appropriate national policies of their own will and choice so as to create conditions conducive to development , and continue to have the primary responsibility for effective implementation of those policies and measures , the full implementation of the Programme of Action is the shared responsibility of these countries and their development partners .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The comprehensive review has identified the need for enhancements within the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General to ensure that it has adequate capacity to meet the demands and requirements of both the Office and the field missions , capability for identifying the policies , tools and capacities needed for future peacekeeping operations , and capable of ensuring effective integration of activities within the Office of Mission Support and the Department .  
The incumbent will be responsible for overall planning , review of field mission budget requirements , resource planning , engineering designs for horizontal and vertical construction , inclusive of modular / prefabricated facilities , and general oversight on and coordinated execution of the mandated engineering programme and related support activities in the peacekeeping operations , ensuring that effective support is rendered in a timely and economical manner .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
In the open and informal consultations held last Thursday at the request of the special coordinator on improved and effective functioning of the Conference , the distinguished representative of Sri Lanka , Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam , we noted the very active participation of delegations .  
Noting that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Supports the Declaration on the Right to Development and underlines the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
In designing the global legal framework against terrorism , the complexity and scope of the definition of terrorism should not and must not hinder the international communitys adoption of urgent , practical and effective measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for their perpetrators .  
Mr . Kerim ( the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) : Pleading for concerted action against international terrorism and for States urgent accession to all relevant international conventions , the Millennium Summit of world leaders anticipated the need for a more effective and comprehensive approach with regard to joint efforts and overall cooperation within the United Nations system .  
That is why we fully agreed with the Chilean representative when , on behalf of the countries of the Rio Group , he stated the firm conviction that measures should be adopted that will contribute to an effective and gradual limitation and monitoring of defence costs in the region , ultimately ensuring the availability of more resources for the social and economic development of our peoples .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
Kyrgyzstan would like to see the future Afghanistan as a peaceful , neutral and friendly State and also holds the view that it is necessary to ensure in that country the international conditions needed for carrying out the Afghan settlement process on a peaceful basis and achieving national reconciliation by setting up a broad-based , effective coalition government that reflects the interests of the entire Afghan people and maintains good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring States .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Invites the Secretary-General , the Economic and Social Council , the Commission for Social Development , the regional commissions , the relevant agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums , within their respective mandates , to take on a priority basis and in a coordinated manner all steps necessary to ensure the effective implementation of all commitments and undertakings contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action and in the further initiatives for social development , and to continue to be actively involved in their follow-up ;  
Reaffirms that a strong political commitment by the international community is needed to implement strengthened and effective international cooperation and assistance for development , including social development , that the mobilization of domestic and international resources for development from all sources is an essential component of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action and of the further initiatives for social development ;  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
It must be recalled here that the loyal and effective commitment of States to general and complete disarmament must serve to assist their access to sophisticated technology designed for peaceful purposes , with due respect for their choices linked to social and economic development .  
The World Summit on Sustainable Development would give the international community a unique opportunity to undertake a holistic and realistic assessment of the real challenges in the field of sustainable development and devise effective means to meet those challenges .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The establishment of an effective , functioning government administration was fundamental to the comprehensive mandate given to UNTAET under Security Council resolution 1272 ( 1999 ) , and is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
The Secretariat , which shared responsibility for the effective functioning of the Organization , should strive for efficiency by improving its billing system : the ability of States to meet the 30-day payment window for peacekeeping assessments would be greatly enhanced if the Secretariat provided an indicative schedule of assessment dates . 
An effective and safe communications infrastructure is essential for the Tribunal : pouch services ; an enhanced communications service , including Internet ; enhanced telephone / fax services to distribute incoming documents on urgent and confidential matters more quickly and safely ; and for connecting off-site locations to the central system .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Call upon all States , consistent with applicable international standards , to take or continue to take measures to strengthen asylum and render protection more effective including through the adoption and implementation of national refugee legislation and procedures for the determination of refugee status and for the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees , giving special attention to vulnerable groups and individuals with special needs , including women , children and the elderly ;  
Relying on social strengths , resorting to legal , administrative , economic and educational means , and adopting a holistic approach were all effective ways to tackle the problem of illicit drugs .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , [ 9 ] and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .

We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
However , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .  Inadequate effective demand and contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure are still very prominent , and no new consumption hot spots are on the horizon .  Problems in our economic life accumulated over the years have all cropped up and the international market still has many uncertain factors - - we should place adequate importance on these problems .  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
We must keep a sober mind on this issue .  The leading comrades of the State Council have stressed the need for many times to make a proper use of the practice of " changing debt into equity , " for it is an effective means for us to assist key state enterprises with well-marketable products , a sound management foundation , and a broad development prospect to lower their liabilities ratio and to turn their deficits into profits .

This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .  They should also establish effective mechanisms to ban the practice of journalists getting personal gains in the guise of making journalistic reports so as to truly fundamentally separate news-covering , editing , and reporting activities from commercial activities .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
The third is to make clear the guiding ideology that the examination , verification and issuance of certificates are only one link of management and are not the entire management of social order and fire prevention .  What is more important is to establish a standard and effective routine supervision and inspection mechanism in order to ensure that once a problem is discovered , it will be dealt with until it is solved and thorough improvements are made .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
Structural readjustment of enterprises means to concentrate effective resources through the market on the industries that concern the state 's economic lifeline and whose scale merit is particularly evident to enable them to establish an appropriate scale of production and operation , so that they will become important industries of the national economy , the pillars of the essential areas , the leaders in economic restructuring , the representatives to international competition , and the leading forces in the state 's regulation and control of the state .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .

He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
In particular , the construction of command automation has been implemented for a long time in a random and isolated manner without effective mutual access and mutual exchange between different forces , which has seriously impeded the whole system from giving full play to its mass effectiveness and powerfulness and which can not meet the requirements for battle under high-tech conditions . 
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .

We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .

That is , with information as the leading factor , attention is paid to laterally renovating or improving the existing system of weapons so that they will be universally applicable and there will be a linkage between them .  This will facilitate accurate access , timely transmission and effective process and use of information , enhance the combined force of attack of the firepower system , thereby raising the overall efficiency of the weaponry and combat system .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
We should further strengthen a sense of anxiety , of urgency and of mission and put into full play an excellent working style of making full use of every minute , work in a sweeping and resolute manner , do work right after we say we will do it and try to do work well .

Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .

and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with .

Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .

It is still unknown whether the reform of the new Taiwan authorities , centered on and motivated by " democracy and human rights , " will be effective in the economic sphere to again achieve a miracle in the free market economy .  However , it is conceivable that this reform of " democracy and human rights " and " rule by law " will objectively bring greater troubles for the motherland 's peace and reunification in disregard of the people 's will .  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .

Meanwhile , effective measures will be taken to plant trees in closed hillsides and to return cultivated areas into forests in an effort to bring desertification under control .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
The circular pointed out : All levels should set sufficient store by the education conducted in small , scattered , or remote units , including the teaching and research section , the scientific research section , the technology section , the medical section or office , the sanitarium for retired cadres , and so on , and should take effective measures to strengthen guidance in this regard .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .

The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
When asked by a reporter to comment on the issue that the US Senate will begin to discuss and put to vote the so-called " China Nonproliferation Law " bill on 10 July , Zhu Bangzao said that China is always opposed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , has exercised strict and effective control over relevant materials according to its military trade and anti-proliferation policies , as well as its relevant international commitments , and has made tremendous efforts to prevent international proliferation .

A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
By grasping the " new reality , " " new problems , " " new demands , " and " new development " in accordance with the demands of the four " close connections , " and carrying out active explorations , we can carry out ideological and political work in a still more vivid and dramatic and effective way .  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
They should extensively carry out the guiding spirit of the national rally for naming double-support model cities ( and counties ) .  In light of promoting the reform , development , and stability of the state as well as army building , they should carry out various activities in a thoroughgoing and effective manner .  They should further consolidate and develop the great situation of the unity between the military and the government as well as the unity between the military units and the people .  
The speech has been made , the goal has been set , the road has been clearly pointed out , and the key lies in the whole party getting to work to vigorously grasp implementation and carry out ideological and political work in a more extensive , deep-going , vivid and dramatic , and effective way .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
Wu Yi pointed out at the same time that confronted with the accelerated development of various countries in the world and the situation of increasingly keen competition , central and local departments at all levels in charge of foreign economic relations and trade must maintain a sober mind , follow the situation closely , analyze the difficulties and uncertain factors that they may encounter in work calmly and objectively , adopt effective measures in good time , and make great efforts to maintain the development momentum of various foreign trade business operations .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .

The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
We should take practical and effective measures to fully arouse the enthusiasm of state-owned , collectively owned , and private enterprises and individual persons for investment , support the healthy development of medium and small enterprises , and change the situation in which the growth of investment by society is slow .  
Ye Zhen put it frankly : China 's present economic pickup is more of a product of policy and external factors , as the economic growth is still lacking in intrinsic vitality , the insufficiency of effective social demand has not yet been fundamentally alleviated , economic structural problems are conspicuous , consumer goods market exploitation is still " obstructed , " and the growth of peasants ' income is slowing down .  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
According to actual conditions and special features of administrative affairs , localities should define ways and set times to make their administrative affairs known to the public in a simple , convenient , and more effective manner .  
Moreover , the main direction of reform and development of state enterprises will continue to be : Introducing a standardized company system reform , bringing about diversification of enterprise investment , deepening reform of enterprise labor , personnel , and distribution systems , exploring an effective means for the management of state assets , accelerating readjustment of the economic structure , implementing strategic reorganization of enterprises , earnestly alleviating the debt burden of enterprises , and constantly improving the management level of enterprises .

President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .

In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .

We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
In this context , my delegation would like to voice its support for the United Nations ongoing work on initiatives relating to the Agenda for Development , which would help us find more pragmatic approaches to development and address the aforementioned economic , social and human security issues in all their dimensions in a more effective and fruitful manner .  
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
At the recent Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing , the international community recognized the crucial role that women play in the development process and acknowledged that effective international cooperation for development will remain an elusive goal unless women can participate fully in the political , economic and social life of their respective societies . 
It is but a means to an end , and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative , given the inescapable reality of today 's global village ; that the world of the future will need more , not fewer , effective international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats ; and that the United Nations remains the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges .  
That revision offered us substantive additional support for the implementation of activities planned within the framework of the national development strategy , in particular effective activities related to the structural adjustment programme , the public sector reform programme and the regional integration programme .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
President Monteiro ( spoke in Portuguese ; English text furnished by the delegation ) : First of all , Sir , I wish to tell you how pleased I am by your election to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly and , at the same time , I wish to express my firm belief that your well-known personal qualities and extensive experience will guarantee that you will lead the work of our Organization in an effective and decisive manner . 
They have understood that democratization is a long-term undertaking , one that must be based on the historical , social and cultural realities of a country if it is to be effective and promote political stability , economic development and social justice .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
But the rather widespread expression of a sincere desire to make the Security Council more effective , more transparent , more legitimate and more democratic are coming up against the fact that this exercise brings together States which are pursuing contradictory perhaps even irreconcilable goals .  
At that size , the Council 's representative character would be enhanced , while at the same time the necessary ability for prompt , effective and continuous action , as required by the Charter , would be preserved .  
The coordination segment can be considerably improved through expeditious and effective implementation of the agreed conclusions of this year 's substantive session on coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the outcomes of major United Nations conferences in the economic , social and related fields .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
This is linked primarily to the absence of a clear international treaty and legal bases , procedures and documents regulating the actions and powers of the relevant international institutions and also national organizations , for securing a timely and effective reaction to emergency situations of a natural and technical origin .  
In the light of the urgency of the need to find timely and effective approaches for addressing the issue , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria , Greece , Moldova , Romania and Ukraine came forward with a set of specific proposals in a joint letter to the Secretary-General of 18 May 1995 , circulated as an official United Nations document ( A / 50 / 189 ) .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for a concerted response from the international community to deal in a more effective manner with the special economic problems of the affected States , I would like to introduce the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 32 , entitled Economic assistance to States affected by the implementation of the Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
As further stated in the Secretary-General 's report in document A / 50 / 526 , on early warning capacities of the United Nations system , the value of a timely and effective warning system to avert losses and to protect resources is essential , particularly as countries begin to incorporate disaster-reduction policies into their social and economic development plans .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
Indonesia , along with the other non-aligned countries , has consistently emphasized that if the United Nations is to become a fully effective central instrument in a new and revitalized international order , reflecting the new realities of the international situation , it should be based on and truly reflect the democratic spirit of equality , equity and transparency , in representation as well as in the decision-making processes .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
This requires concerted action to ensure a consistent and incremental flow of resources , effective participation by African countries in international trade and a strategy to resolve the crushing debt problem faced by the continent .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
It is precisely in these areas that both Organizations have accumulated an inspiring operational capacity , expertise and legal basis that , if rationally combined and divided between them , would make it possible to substantially improve work done in the search for effective responses to international challenges .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
One representative raised the question of whether the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was sufficiently effective to safeguard individual women against gender discrimination and called for the endorsement of the proposal for an optional protocol , as agreed upon at the European regional preparatory meeting .

Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
An effective consultative process should be established and implemented with concerned groups of society where the formulation and decision-making of all components of the programmes are based on a nationwide consultative process drawing on community meetings , regional workshops and national seminars , as appropriate .

Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
An effective advisory service and technical assistance programme was a major concern of all those who took part in the World Conference on Human Rights , Governments , United Nations agencies and programmes , regional and national institutions and non-governmental organizations alike , and the Vienna Declaration makes such a programme one of the principal means for achieving its objectives and those of the Programme of Action .  
In addition , the Declaration stated that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development required effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .

Aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace in Central America , and bearing in mind that the Central American Integration System constitutes the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development can be promoted in an effective , orderly and coherent manner ,  
Since the completion of the previous report , the Special Rapporteur has received information of more instances of the judicial system failing to take effective measures to identify and punish those responsible for crimes and to provide families and relatives of Serbian victims with proper legal responses to the death or disappearance of their relatives .  
In introducing the report , the representative pointed out that the priorities set out in the White Paper to the Parliament ( Storting ) in the spring of 1993 included an active child-care policy with a focus on shared family responsibilities between the parents , renewed efforts to reach the goal of equal pay , and more effective actions against the abuse of women and sexual violence .  
The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market .

Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .

More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
With regard to item 114 ( b ) of the draft agenda ( Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ) , the Secretary-General wishes to recall resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 whereby the General Assembly , inter alia , decided to mark the end of the United Nations Year for Tolerance at a special commemorative plenary meeting of its fiftieth session .

The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .

To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .

NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
NULLAlthough no complaints were received about violations directly linked to trade union activities during the period in question , complaints continued to be received of violations of the right to swift and effective justice , involving leaders or workers who were subjected to threats , dismissed or subjected to reprisals because they organized themselves into trade unions or asserted their interests as workers .

38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
Even the most rigorous and effective programmes of domestic economic stabilization and structural adjustment would leave those countries with serious obstacles to moving to a sustained and sustainable development path .

Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;

Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
asks the United Nations Security Council to ensure the full implementation of that agreement by adopting a feasible mandate based on the establishment of an effective provisional administration and the deployment of a credible international force equipped with sufficient resources .  
I have recently intensified my personal contacts with the heads of the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization , as well as with other executive heads .  A key objective of these consultations , and of ongoing discussions in ACC , is to ensure that these processes build on each other and result in a more effective and coherent United Nations system .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
There is need for further systematic and progressive effort in order to achieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
As we seek to enhance the relevance of this Organization to the world today , it is imperative that we understand that the vast majority of the people of this world expect the United Nations to be a principal actor for progress and change , and to be equipped to play an effective and leading role in improving the economic and social situation of the world 's citizens .  
In closing , let me say that my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you , Sir , and all other members over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative , effective and united United Nations for the twenty-first century .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
While drawing the international community 's attention to the irrelevant linkage between the implementation of the aforementioned resolution and recent events in northern Iraq , and to the humanitarian appeals inside the country , we call on Iraq to cooperate fully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees the effective and swift implementation of this resolution .  
While actively supporting the Commission , the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts alone can not guarantee equitable security in the region if they are not paired with other effective and practical measures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there and to promote comprehensive and unconditional acceptance of international monitoring and inspection of all activities related to this matter .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Considering the late stage of our work , and given the importance that my delegation attached to the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the work of the Preparatory Commission in this regard , and in the spirit of cooperation , we decided not to insist on our original proposal on the work of the Preparatory Commission and agreed to language that was incorporated in A / C . 1 / 51 / L . 48 / Rev . 1 as a new operative paragraph 6 .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;

Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;

In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .

Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .

Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .

The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;

ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
At the same time , existing modalities will be reformed and streamlined in seven ways : reduced meetings ; fewer and improved reports and revitalized publications ; new networking arrangements ; increased interactions with member States ; more effective technical support , including use of country representatives ; enhanced South-South cooperation ; and strategic alliances with partners .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .

Much more information is needed regarding the actual and potential costs on various alternative routes available to the Central Asian republics as a basis for regional and national decisions on transport priorities for investment in infrastructure , technical assistance , training , better management and improved cooperative arrangements .  More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
It called for an effective regional institutional mechanism to provide for a harmonized approach to transit transport matters , and it urged all concerned international and regional organizations to strengthen their activities which promoted regionally adopted legal and administrative solutions that facilitated regional and international transport and trade .

At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
The need to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to adopt appropriate and effective measures to ensure the prevention , detection and punishment of offences relating to nuclear material , which are a matter of grave concern to the international community , led the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to adopt the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 13 / at Vienna on 26 October 1979 .

While the eradication strategy relied heavily on the use of insecticides to reduce or interrupt malaria transmission and attempted to eliminate infection through case detection and treatment , using the same approaches in all areas , the current strategy aims to control malaria disease through early diagnosis and prompt treatment , including improving the management of severe and complicated malaria , controlling epidemics and using preventive measures that are locally effective and sustainable .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .

This unprecedented formula of a coordinated , inter-institutional , international cooperative effort to assist States in their observance of mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council may have been a decisive factor in making these measures a valuable and effective policy instrument in the graduated response to threats to international peace and security in this case .  
On 30 May 1992 , the Council , by its resolution 757 ( 1992 ) , determining that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other parts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia constituted a threat to international peace and security , condemned the failure of the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take effective measures to fulfil the requirements of resolution 752 ( 1992 ) and , acting under Chapter VII of the Charter , decided to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against that country .

A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Having reviewed the steps taken towards the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50 / 145 and 50 / 146 , including other relevant mandates in this area , it can be concluded that the credibility of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme will be measured , to a large extent , by its ability to provide effective support to requesting countries in drafting legislation , creating independent systems for the administration of justice , establishing police forces that are respectful of the rule of law and setting up national institutions for protecting fundamental human rights .

It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .

Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
First , a modern , fair and transparent personnel policy , in which placement and promotion played an important part , and the strict implementation of that policy were crucial determinants of the effective future performance of the Organization . The General Assembly , in resolution 47 / 226 , had urged the Secretary-General to improve all personnel policies , yet that requirement had still not been implemented .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 20 September 1996 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee . 
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election and take part freely in a representative Government , and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
In accordance with the Declaration , equity should be a basic principle of health policy , and such policy should be based on the Almaty principle of Health for All ; health services should be effective , efficient , accessible , affordable , compassionate , and socially acceptable .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
Bearing in mind that the objective of those programmes is to develop within each country a national mechanism to manage and execute an integrated programme of mine clearance and that , as a consequence of armed conflicts , the affected countries are facing considerable economic constraints , only the effective contribution of the international community can enable us gradually to overcome the serious problems caused by existing landmines .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
" Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
A key element of an effective arms control regime is provision for complete , accurate and timely exchange of relevant information , including the size , structure , location and military doctrine of military forces as well as their activities ; - Verification . 
Criteria and indicators for application at the national level should be [ simple , ] [ practical , ] scientifically based and cost effective and reflect , inter alia , economic , social , biological and ecological circumstances . 
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
There should be a specific provision in the operative part of the statute devoted to the principle of complementarity which would define the nature and scope of cooperation between the court and national judicial systems , and the obligation of States parties to cooperate with the court in an effective and speedy manner .  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
If democratization is the most reliable way to legitimize and improve national governance , it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization , making it more open and responsive by increasing participation , more efficient by allowing for burden-sharing and more effective by allowing for comparative advantage and greater creativity .  
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Through its promotional activities , UNHCR sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , and to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to the Office , including by means of their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries that have not yet done so to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU requires for its continued success an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations , responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members , the developing countries .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
The speedy commencement and rapid conclusion of good-faith negotiations to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice , is of paramount importance to the future of the international community .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures , such as , inter alia , arms control , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , confidence-building measures , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants , demining and conversion , often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective rehabilitation and social and economic development ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
As part of the follow-up to the Social Summit , Governments have reported a variety of actions towards the eradication of poverty : adopting national targets for poverty reduction ; promoting job creation and growth ; maintaining effective safety nets , including comprehensive social security , universal health care and education services ; providing adequate housing ; enhancing social integration of the poor ; and undertaking studies and surveys to improve national information on poverty .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
Improving these pragmatic arrangements appears to be less costly and more effective for the time being than undertaking a radical reform of common services , unless convincing proof is offered to the contrary .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the member countries of the European Union are fully committed to this goal and that the United Nations General Assembly , with 150 votes in favour and none against , adopted last fall a resolution in which urgent and vigorous measures for the conclusion of an effective , legally binding international agreement leading to a comprehensive ban on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of APLMs are called for .  
After briefly reviewing the achievements of UNCED and continuing impediments to sustainable development , the present report identifies a way forward that includes fiscally responsible government actions , more effective economic incentives , improvement in the enabling conditions for change , and other market-oriented policies designed to optimize sustainable development in the areas of energy , water and transportation , while building in a concern for social equity .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
The Committee shall not declare a communication admissible unless it has ascertained that all available [ legal ] domestic remedies have been exhausted [ in accordance with generally recognized rules of international law ] ; [ this shall not apply where the Committee considers the application of the remedies to be [ unreasonably prolonged ] [ unreasonable ] or unlikely to bring effective relief ] [ unless the claimant demonstrates that such remedies are ineffective or that the application of the remedies has been unduly prolonged ] ; 
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining its multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at the universal and effective respect of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
Several resident coordinators believe that a more effective collaboration in country operations should be encouraged both by Bretton Woods institutions and the United Nations system organizations at headquarters level , while another group of resident coordinators suggests that the Bretton Woods institutions be associated in the joint programming consultation of the United Nations system , through common participation in periodic meetings on programming and coordination , and regular consultation on planning and strategy issues .  
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
The deliberations of the three committees confirmed once again how the parallel developments in cartographic and in information technology were rapidly bringing to users cost-effective applications in surveying , charting and mapping as a comprehensive set of the tools and effective approaches required to meet the challenge of sustainable development and the priorities of the countries in the region .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
In the absence of a purposeful government programme of national reconciliation and effective police security throughout Croatia , UNHCR and UNTAES agree that all potential returnees should be encouraged to use the operational procedures to be assured of their full rights to reconstruction assistance , social benefits and security .  
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 45 / 179 of 21 December 1990 , by which the Assembly established the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the single body with the exclusive responsibility for coordinating all drug control activities within the United Nations system and for providing effective leadership in promoting international cooperation in drug control , thereby producing a catalytic impact on other international and national bodies ,  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The Government with its various structures has found itself unable to ensure systemwide and effective management of the economic and social processes and proper implementation of the reforms ; its has displayed poor initiative and spent its time largely " putting out fires " .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
Parts are considered equivalent to one piece when a suitable method of glued assembly is used as for instance Lindermann joint , tongue and groove joint , ship lap or rabbet joint ; or butt joint with at least two corrugated metal fasteners at each joint , or when other methods at least equally effective are used . 
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
The international community has learned that the most pressing developmental issues facing today 's world - poverty and social development , population , governance , gender equality , environment - transcend both sectoral and national boundaries , and effective responses must be multidimensional and global .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
This duty is impaired when institutions fail to comply with their legal obligation to provide , in a timely manner , for appropriate means of guaranteeing full respect for human rights or of carrying out prompt , exhaustive and effective investigations when such rights are violated .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
A key component of its work is to assist national institutions in playing an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and to forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
He indicated that in support of the devolution of responsibility to the most effective managerial level , in some carefully defined areas , consolidation provided considerable cost saving and other administrative benefits and could also result in more effective services , including those provided through the establishment of a common services facility , an area in which work was already proceeding . 
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
That finding by the special session was echoed by the International Court of Justice , which concluded in its epoch-making Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 which should be a constant reminder , particularly to nuclear-weapon States that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control . 
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
5 ) . the Secretary-General further stated that he " is therefore obliged to point out that unless Member States take early and effective action to reverse this trend , there will be no alternative to suspending even the reduced functions performed locally by the centres and closing their offices in the three capitals concerned " . 
We express the hope that joint efforts will be successful and effective and that international personnel will receive from the Tajik people adequate support and hospitality , and will thus be able vigorously and fully to discharge the broad range of responsible and important tasks included in the updated UNMOT mandate .  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Calls upon all States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and support efforts within the United Nations system to adopt effective measures concerning the fulfilment of the right of the child to an adequate standard of living and the continuous and progressive improvement of living and housing conditions as stipulated in the relevant international agreements and conventions ;  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Almost two years ago , the International Court of Justice , in a historic Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , unanimously concluded that States parties to the NPT have the obligation not only to begin but also to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
The historical stance of Ecuador , a peace-loving country , has led it to reaffirm that the general and complete disarmament process , under effective international control , must move forward with firm steps , responding to the legal and moral conscience of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , which are pioneers in this area , as evidenced by the Treaty of Tlatelolco . 
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
The main activities are aimed at , inter alia , raising public awareness , improving understanding of money-laundering , promoting the adoption of relevant legislation , improving law enforcement capacities to combat money-laundering , training and developing infrastructure for the implementation of an effective money-laundering strategy .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
At its fifty _ second session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1996 / 15 , reaffirmed that the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development required perseverance and concrete efforts and that that dynamic process should be pursued at all appropriate levels , including through the elaboration of international and national strategies , which required the effective contribution of States , organs and organizations of the United Nations system and of non-governmental organizations active in that field .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
As soon as practicable , after an issue has been included in the work programme , a structured and detailed design plan for the inspection , evaluation or investigation and a detailed plan for scheduling activities , including the most effective and timely means of gathering the information required , is prepared by the responsible Inspector ( s ) , assisted by the Executive Secretary and designated research staff .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
As a representative of national organizations which remained in place after international organizations had completed their work , the Federation trusted that more governments would take steps to create an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue and effective cooperation , so that non-governmental organizations could function effectively . 
In the United States , the Department of Justice is engaged in an ongoing initiative to establish effective and productive working relationships between the federal Government and state governments and local governmental subdivisions .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
ITC and UNCTAD have anticipated this trend , and our cooperation in the area of trade efficiency has been the sine qua non for the effective contribution we have been able to make in a practical , result _ oriented and business _ like fashion for making international trade transactions more efficient , less costly , and therefore more affordable to developing countries and their enterprises .  
Together with the Department of Administration and Management , the Office has embarked upon an effort to simplify programme monitoring and evaluation , including reporting to legislative bodies , with a view to transforming it from what is perceived as a cumbersome procedure of mere quantitative reporting to oversight bodies into a meaningful and effective tool for managers to review the performance of the function for which they are responsible .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
However , the Inspectors considered that examination of the issues in the report was timely since they believed that a modern , fair , and transparent personnel policy , of which placement and promotion were an important part , and its strict implementation , were crucial determinants of effective future performance of the United Nations .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration ;  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
Since 1968 , one of the Government 's priorities has been to put an end to all the manifestations of administrative corruption , which were widespread during previous eras , through the promulgation of numerous decrees and the adoption of effective measures to enable the Iraqi people to enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights .  
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
In order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation in the area of juvenile justice , the Committee transmits , as it may consider appropriate , to specialized agencies , UNICEF and other competent bodies any reports from States parties that contain a request , or indicate a need , for advisory services and technical assistance , along with observations and suggestions of the Committee , if any , on those requests or indications ( in accordance with article 45 ( b ) of the Convention ) .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Successful efforts at the regional level demonstrate the feasibility of this undertaking and constitute proof of the ability of the international community to arrive at common concepts and to devise generally acceptable methods and strategies that would form the basis of improved and effective international cooperation .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;

Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context , that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } promotional activities sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , as well as to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to UNHCR , including through their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
To that end , the focus of the subprogramme will be on the role of the Organization in furthering economic and social development , democracy and human rights and peace and security , and enhancing the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of meeting the challenges posed in a rapidly changing international environment .  
The central thrust of the subprogramme is the promotion of the Convention and the related agreements by facilitating their understanding , their widest possible acceptance , their uniform and consistent application and their effective implementation , as well as assisting States in their efforts to derive full practical benefits from the international legal regime , and in the enjoyment of their rights and the fulfilment of their obligations arising therefrom .  
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
The establishment of a workable and effective system of cooperation between the court and States was of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the court , and the statute should contain explicit provisions on the matter that drew on existing structures and practice in international judicial cooperation .  
Thus , it supported General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 S , a logical stance fully consistent with the joint action of the European Union , which is committed to the goal of the total elimination of anti _ personnel landmines and shall work actively towards the achievement at the earliest possible date of an effective international agreement to ban these weapons worldwide .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
To this end , recognizing the need for the gradual formation and development of a common economic area through the creation of conditions for the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour , the Parties shall take effective measures to coordinate a strategy for carrying out economic reforms , deepening economic integration on the basis of mutual advantage and harmonizing their economic legislation .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
The inventory of financial needs and the data base of financial sources would have the following characteristics in order to ensure their effective use : ( i ) available to participants in the CCD consultative processes ; ( ii ) disseminated through various channels , including the Internet ; ( iii ) packaged to meet the needs of customers ; and ( iv ) frequently updated .  27 .  Inventory of financial requirements .  
IFAD 's Technical Assistance Grants Programme for Research and Training is a critical instrument for the pursuit of IFAD \ x { e5b8 } corporate strategy with regard to the development of innovative and effective means to eradicate rural poverty in IFAD \ x { e5b8 } own operations and , through increased policy dialogue and collaborative programming , in the operations of the entire ensemble of the operations of stakeholders in rural development .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) ;  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 had amended Muslim personal law by modifying inheritance provisions , prohibiting additional marriages after the first marriage without permission from an Arbitration Council constituted according to the Ordinance , imposing procedural restrictions before divorce became effective , prescribing a special procedure for determining the amount of maintenance payable by a husband to his wife and modifying provisions concerning dowers .  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
In its second Advisory Opinion , the Inter-American Court stated that the ' essential ' judicial guarantees that are not subject to derogation according to article 27 include habeas corpus , amparo , and any other effective remedy before judges or competent tribunals which is designed to guarantee respect for the rights and freedoms whose suspension are not authorized by the American Convention .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development , as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , where stress is laid on the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which promotes partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aimed at universal and effective observance of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
A view widely shared by Governments was that the formulation of effective recommendations for action had to be based on a solid understanding of the various aspects of international migration and development , and on reliable information regarding the multifaceted experience of the countries involved in the international migration process .  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
Furthermore , since international cooperation would have to be strengthened , as the Secretary-General had stated in his report ( A / 51 / 309 ) , the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949 , to which fewer than half of the Member States were party , should be revised and a new body established with responsibility for examining reports on the implementation of that Convention , in order to make it more effective .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent .

The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Subject to the legal principles of the State Party , the liability of legal persons may be criminal , civil or administrative and such persons , if held liable , shall be subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
To take all effective measures to end and to prevent all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary custody and receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards , and to investigate all reported acts of torture brought to its attention ;  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
At a time of rapid and tumultuous global change , if UNDP can leverage this precious asset into a more effective role in helping countries to meet their development challenges , it will have a remarkable impact on human development and poverty eradication .  
His country shared the view that the legal regime currently applicable to outer space could not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space , and it was therefore imperative to adopt new measures with adequate and effective verifying provisions .  
He is also of the view that the dedicated protection of selected United Nations personnel undertaking operations at locations where intimidation and resistance is likely , would provide the confidence essential for more effective police operations and legal proceedings against entrenched political and criminal interests .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
His delegation was convinced that an international convention against transnational organized crime would be an effective international legal instrument for Member States in their common struggle , and he hoped that preparatory work would be completed by 2000 .  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
In this connection , Poland , Switzerland and the National Womens Council of Catalonia stated that fundamental standards were intended to ensure the effective protection of human beings in all situations , especially during situations of internal violence when some of the most horrible atrocities are committed , both by Governments and by non-State actors .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development ( Agenda for Development ( General Assembly resolution 51 / 240 , annex ) , para . 
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
Although still in the development stage , the results-oriented annual reports ( ROARs ) have the potential of becoming an integral part of a viable framework for the future , one based on effective planning and execution and rooted in results-based management .  
We hope that this omission will not set a negative precedent in the future , because we consider such a provision to be necessary to guarantee the effective and independent functioning of the Organization , particularly with respect to a Mission that is expected to be financed mainly through voluntary contributions .  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .  
If we do not rapidly take effective measures to correct the negative effects of that process , the threats of social disintegration will become increasingly real and disturbing , and the possibility of establishing stability and lasting peace even more remote .  
The ambitious intention to transform the Council into a more representative , more democratic , more open , more transparent , and hence more effective body makes for an extraordinarily complex and delicate task that requires effort and time , enormous patience and firm political will from all participants in the exercise .  
With regard to the permanent and observer missions , every effort would be made in future to encourage the host country authorities to keep to an absolute minimum the unpredictable and inconvenient , or what might even be considered by some delegations the undignified , aspects of effective security operations .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
The Office is increasing its efforts to meet all outstanding requests for assistance from individual countries and new institutions , and seeking to increase effective coordination with other international agencies and regional and international organizations of national institutions in order to ensure that there is no duplication of effort .  
At the 8 th meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee , the representative of the Russian Federation stated that the growing ability of terrorist groups to acquire sophisticated technologies and weapons of mass destruction made international terrorism a most serious problem calling for effective and concerted action by the international community .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .  
We are hopeful that the effective implementation of this decision will go a long way in supporting national efforts to reduce the debt burden of these countries to more serviceable levels and open for them the opportunities for real and sustained economic growth .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Armenia believes that efficient and effective cooperation among the Black Sea countries will help consolidate the strategic economic potential inherent in this area , promote free trade , open roads and other means of communication and foster the welfare of peoples , thus stimulating the peaceful settlement of existing political disputes and reinforcing the independence , sovereignty and democratic development of the BSECO member States . 
This imbues the Courts current report with a special character , since this objective for the Decade of International Law coincides with the supreme objective behind the establishment of the International Court of Justice in 1946 : that the Court should be an effective , efficient judicial means for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
The symbolic and joyful concurrence of events should encourage all of us to make more active and effective efforts to ensure that current and future generations will enjoy a brighter future , free from the current problems challenging the international community .  
The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction the multifaceted , fruitful and useful activities of the IAEA , a unique international organization that brings together the efforts of Member States to ensure the effective and safe use of the achievements of nuclear science and technology for the good of humankind in the spirit of the lofty United Nations principles of humanism . 
My delegation also wishes to express very special appreciation for the excellent work accomplished by the Counsel of the Brazilian Mission , Mrs . Marcela Nicodemos who for the third year in a row led the informal consultations that brought about the final text of this draft resolution in an effective , professional and expeditious manner .  
The effective implementation of the Code , whose substance is broad but necessary and praiseworthy , would meet the basic goals for strengthening our fragile democracies and would enable us to take the proper path towards consolidating this process , which is a crucial task for our peoples .  
However , the continuous , intransigent Israeli position in violation of international legitimacy with regard to returning the occupied Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese territories to their rightful sovereigns , which is the first and basic prerequisite for establishing peace , continues to impede the effective resumption of these negotiations .  
It will be necessary in future to support constructive contacts between the OSCE mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the relevant United Nations structures in carrying out such vital tasks as safeguarding the rights of minorities , resolving the problem of refugees and ensuring the effective functioning of the federal and municipal authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Two months later , at Sirte in Libya , the fourth extraordinary session of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU considered the ways and means of strengthening the organization with a view to rendering it more effective and adaptable to social , political and economic changes and to making it the preferred instrument for collective action for Africa and for cooperation with the rest of the world .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
Even though we continue to be collectively and individually committed to finding a comprehensive solution that would make the Security Council more representative , effective and transparent , delegations are also getting exhausted and drained by the repetitiveness of the debate , as we run around in circles trying to square major differences .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
As one of the delegations that first introduced the issue at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 1979 , we are firmly committed to the goal of achieving a Council that is more democratic , transparent , effective , accountable and relevant to current global realities.Six years have elapsed since the inception of the Open-ended Working Group , and we now stand at the threshold of a new millennium .  
While , because of the provisions written into the Charter , it may not be possible to eliminate the veto , the General Assembly , after witnessing for more than half a century initiatives for peace and security being stifled time and again by the use of veto , can not be expected to create additional obstacles to the effective functioning of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security by adding to the number of veto-wielding countries .  
He added that while almost every agency and operational arm of the United Nations had a special programme devoted to Africa , and even though the Organization had spent generous amounts of its resources on the continent , the United Nations still needed to be more involved in Africa and play a more effective role , as it does elsewhere , without undue preconditions .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The centrality of effective , participatory governance including through free and regular elections and democratic national and international economic and social institutions .  
Support scientific research into and the development of safe , affordable , effective and easily accessible female-controlled methods of family planning , including dual methods such as microbicides and female condoms that protect against both sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) and prevent pregnancy , taking into account paragraph 96 of the report of the Fourth World Conference on Women ;  
Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Acknowledging that millions of women do not have access to means that have proved effective in preventing and lowering infection rates , such as male and female condoms , anti-retroviral drugs , relevant preventive education , acceptable counselling and testing services ,  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;  
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
Promoting broad-based sustainable development through tourism while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the environment requires an effective partnership between key stakeholders at the local , national , regional and international levels and participation at all levels of tourism planning , development and assessment .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
With regard to the development and diffusion of biotechnology , it was emphasized that , while national level research and development efforts were critical in order to ensure , among other things , that local conditions were taken into account , knowledge-sharing through North-South and South-South partnership and networking and regional initiatives were crucial for effective transfer and diffusion of technology .  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The resolution stressed that there would be no renegotiation of the existing agreements contained therein ; it defined the organizational aspects of the preparatory body and the special session and stressed the need for the effective participation of all stakeholders according to modalities similar to those applied in Cairo .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
She urged the Secretariat to take early and effective measures for the recruitment , on a broad geographical basis , of the staff required to replace the gratis personnel , and also to incorporate into the phase-out plan detailed transitional arrangements with a view to minimizing the cost of the process .  
He was concerned that persons from the countries directly involved might be assigned to such posts , and believed that only persons from neutral countries should be assigned to the new civil affairs unit to ensure the efficient , effective and impartial functioning of the Mission .  
The objective of health policy is to correct the imbalances in the national health system and make health care provision more effective and equitable , taking account of the constraints on choice imposed by the repercussions of demographic pressure and changes , the roles of the participants , and the funding and administration mechanisms for the sector .  
Accordingly , Moroccos health policy addresses five main concerns : a ) more effective mobilization and use of resources ; b ) the building of a new relationship between the public and private sectors regarding health matters ; c ) streamlined management and regulation of the overall health care system ; d ) improved services with control of spending ; and e ) participation by local communities .  
Although there were average monthly vacancy rates of 4.9 per cent for international staff and 6.9 per cent for local staff ( see annex III to the present report ) , additional requirements under local staff salaries and common staff costs were necessary due to the unforeseen retroactive increase of 12.5 per cent in local staff salaries effective from 1 January 1997 .  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
One important step would be the introduction of a comprehensive national legislation that removed major stumbling blocks and put into effect an efficient and effective policy for the applications of space technology in the development of the social and economic sectors .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , 25 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 2 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
In his report to the General Assembly ( A 53-355 , para . 22 ) , the independent expert on Haiti reported that over the past year , Haiti had begun facing the challenge of putting into place a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable and accessible justice system .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
Recalling the widely shared desire expressed during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly , held on 17 and 18 September 1998 , which constituted a renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , to continue discussions with a view to developing a coherent and effective response to the opportunities and challenges being offered by globalization and interdependence ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Our appeal has received further backing from the most prestigious international judicial institution , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which in its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 called on all States to pursue in good faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective control .  
As a result , the cause of nuclear disarmament has now made a qualitative leap forward , and is strengthened by the unanimous response of the Court that obligations exist to continue and complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all is aspects under strict and effective control .  
It was of paramount importance that the Court be truly independent , fair , effective and efficient , so that it could dispense justice in accordance with principles acceptable to the international community , bearing in mind diverse legal systems and cultures .  
He looked forward to the establishment of a permanent , independent , effective court , empowered to discharge specific tasks , yet not a substitute for national courts .  
In particular , he supported the creation of an effective , independent , impartial , efficient , universal international criminal court .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .  
Its composition and its relations with sovereign States and the United Nations would need the most careful consideration , in order to ensure that the Court would be permanent , effective , independent , efficient , credible and trustworthy .  
The community of nations had a fundamental interest in contributing to a more stable world by creating an international criminal court that was independent , effective and fair .  
An independent , effective and fair court must be perceived to be a judicial body guided by legal rather than political considerations .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
With regard to the above , there have not been sufficient efforts or effective measures by the Government to replace the authoritarian components of its system of organization with the elementary principles characteristic of any pluralist and democratic society , this being most apparent at the middle levels of the State and particularly in local administrations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
In light of this , what is most appropriate now , as Ethiopia has made known repeatedly , and what is called for , to reverse what Eritrea is determined to make imminent , is the application of effective and meaningful pressure on Eritrea in all areas - political , diplomatic and economic - to force it to see reason and to give peace a chance .  
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .

When , at its fifty-second session , the Committee had been required to take a decision on paragraph 21 of the text that was to become resolution 52-118 , his delegation had drawn attention to the tendency to adopt resolutions that were political in nature on the methods of work of bodies which had been established pursuant to international instruments.If that trend continued , it might have an adverse impact on the effective implementation of the instruments .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The system of periodic reporting established within the context of all major international human rights instruments is the central element in monitoring full and effective national implementation of international human rights standards .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
While article 3 , paragraph 1 of the Declaration places upon States the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development , article 4 , paragraph 2 clearly states that effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
The Durban Declaration welcomed the growing interest shown worldwide in the establishment or strengthening of independent and pluralistic national institutions , particularly in Africa , and reaffirmed the important role that national institutions must play , both with regard to their responsibilities vis - - vis Governments and their responsibility to promote human rights and provide effective redress when those rights are violated .

In the biennium 20002001 , the focus of the Executive Office will be on improving the provision of programme support in a more efficient and effective manner , both in the traditional areas of responsibility and in the additional aspects of human resources management that are expected to be decentralized and delegated from the central administration of the Secretariat to the Department .  
The international community can and must play a major and continuing role in supporting these efforts by working with the countries involved to promote reconciliation , broaden political participation , lay the groundwork for economic recovery and help build systems of justice that are fair , credible and effective . 
Requests the Secretary-General , in the further enhancement of the Organizations career development system , to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels ;  
Overall , the ECLAC secretariat is intent on continuing its devotion of major efforts towards the development of a more efficient and effective secretariat through cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training and improvement of horizontal and vertical communication among staff .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved .

Consultations are being undertaken with the organizations concerned to refine this concept further .

The Conference noted that two principal benefits that effective sharing of information would allow were ( a ) the ready retrieval of information on demonstration projects that could raise the awareness of decision makers ; and ( b ) the relative ease for countries in the region to carry out comparisons of operational agricultural methodologies in order to make decisions that would improve the effectiveness of their national programmes .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .

This requires an environment conducive to private savings , the consolidation of public finances , efficient and effective mechanisms for the allocation of public expenditure , and adequate room for private initiative in short , sound macroeconomic policies .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
Convinced of the importance of establishing a restrictive national legislative and / or regulatory framework for , inter alia , small arms and light weapons , including criminal sanctions and effective administrative control ,  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .

Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .  
The Interlaken process focused on the practical and technical aspects involved in designing effective financial sanctions and ensuring their successful implementation .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
My delegation has also subscribed to the premise that for sanctions to be effective , they must be implemented within a prescribed time frame and be subject to close monitoring and periodic review in order to ensure their continued usefulness and validity , as well as to evaluate their impact on vulnerable populations and neighbouring States .  
It is fitting that Ireland , as a strong and consistent supporter of East Timors peaceful transition to a stable , democratic and effective and independent State , is presiding over the Council at this important point in East Timors transition process .  
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .  
In its resolution 2000 / 64 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite all States to provide practical examples of activities that have been effective in strengthening good governance practices for the promotion of human rights at the national level , including activities in the context of development cooperation between States , for inclusion in a compilation of indicative ideas and practices that could be consulted by the interested States when required .

In its economic policy , neutral Turkmenistan has proclaimed and is consistently putting into practice the open doors principle , aimed at mutually advantageous cooperation with all States , and is establishing equal conditions for the effective functioning of foreign companies in its territory , irrespective of their national origin and form of ownership .  
It was stated that , in Argentina , at the universities in Crdoba and Neuqun , privately supported projects involving small and inexpensive satellites devoted to scientific and technological experiments were being undertaken as an effective means of promoting good education in space engineering and technology and of attracting talented young people to the subject .  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
Experts indicated that margin of preference in international tendering allocated to local firms should be sufficient to allow their effective participation , and that criteria established for participation in multilaterally financed projects should not be so stringent as to exclude domestic construction firms in developing countries .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
The public authorities guaranteed the effective implementation of human rights , and all detected abuses had received the judicial and administrative attention required by law .  
In brief , those conclusions found that in Equatorial Guinea any person can be deprived of liberty with no effective judicial remedy , and even subjected to torture , as a result of the profound distrust entertained by the Government towards any form of dissidence , which has prevented the political agreements concluded since 1993 between the governing party and opposition parties from ever being given effect .

The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
The vulnerability of the population is compounded by the continuing effects of the drought , the escalating conflict , massive internal displacement , the disruption of the livelihoods of farmers and labourers normally engaged in poppy cultivation , the absence of significant economic recovery , and the lack of a single effective national authority .  
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
The review had primarily addressed whether the reform had fulfilled the three strategic goals of making the normative , analytical and operational functions clearer and more consistent with each other ; providing more effective policy support to intergovernmental bodies ; and improving the coordination of United Nations activities in the socio-economic area through integrated policy advice .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .

Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .  
Nonetheless , the establishment of such focal points at the national level is a desirable and positive development , as the Commission may wish to reiterate , provided that such an initiative is accompanied by the provision by the national authorities of the minimum required resources , the authority to collect information from the various actors active in the field in the country and the creation of an effective machinery for that purpose .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
Many delegations stated that debt reduction should be accelerated for heavily indebted poor countries , in conjunction with effective poverty eradication programmes , and that the enhanced HIPC initiative should be funded through new and additional resources and implemented as soon as possible .

Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;

The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .

It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;

As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
An integrated approach to development , including consistency in policy-making , drawing upon synergies of different policy areas and comparative advantages of different actors , leading to an effective mobilization of financing for development from both public and private sources , is crucial for achieving the international development targets .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .

In recognizing that there is a growing awareness of the positive impact of effective social policies on economic and social development , the special session stressed that social development requires , inter alia , not only economic activity , but also a reduction in inequality in the distribution of wealth and more equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth within and among nations .  
Therefore , effective 2001 , the following changes are envisaged : ( a ) more emphasis will be placed on following up action plans prepared by offices ; ( b ) senior management will be provided with regular analyses of results of CSA workshops ; ( c ) CSA workshops will be targeted to ( i ) resident representatives and managers taking up new assignments , in order to help them quickly to identify key issues facing their offices , and ( ii ) selected country offices undergoing the re-profiling exercise .

Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .

In this respect , it was felt that the role of the United Nations within the system would be effective to the extent that participatory approaches were pursued , and the United Nations built on its role as a forum where the competencies of different agencies could be drawn together and where their respective constituencies were engaged in a dialogue towards common , overriding objectives .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
This approach requires a comprehensive and holistic framework to articulate needs , and generate effective strategies and efficient policies , covering a broad range of interactive determinants , including demographic dynamics , social and economic conditions and natural resource endowments .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .

First , it is unreasonable to believe that a clean and effective police force can be established when the majority of police officers , especially in Republika Srpska , are paid an irregular wage that is not sufficient for daily life .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .

Acknowledging that prevention of HIV infection must be the mainstay of the national , regional and international response to the epidemic ; and that prevention , care , support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic ;  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
These harmful conflicts are breaking out and are becoming genuine threats to peace precisely at a time when what is required , more than ever , is coordinated and effective action by the international community , with all the necessary resources to address the very serious social and economic problems facing us .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To develop and implement , where possible , effective disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , including the effective collection , control , storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons , particularly in post-conflict situations , unless another form of disposition or use has been duly authorized , and such weapons have been marked and the alternate form of disposition or use has been recorded , and to include , where applicable , specific provisions for these programmes in peace agreements .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
Participants affirmed their commitment to providing the full financing and speedy and effective implementation of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) Initiative , which is essential for freeing domestic budgetary resources for poverty reduction , and they undertook to make expeditious progress towards full cancellation of outstanding official bilateral debt within the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative . 15 .  The Framework for Partnership ( A / CONF . 191 / 11 , chap .  
While least developed countries should assume ownership of designing and formulating appropriate national policies of their own will and choice so as to create conditions conducive to development , and continue to have the primary responsibility for effective implementation of those policies and measures , the full implementation of the Programme of Action is the shared responsibility of these countries and their development partners .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The comprehensive review has identified the need for enhancements within the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General to ensure that it has adequate capacity to meet the demands and requirements of both the Office and the field missions , capability for identifying the policies , tools and capacities needed for future peacekeeping operations , and capable of ensuring effective integration of activities within the Office of Mission Support and the Department .  
The incumbent will be responsible for overall planning , review of field mission budget requirements , resource planning , engineering designs for horizontal and vertical construction , inclusive of modular / prefabricated facilities , and general oversight on and coordinated execution of the mandated engineering programme and related support activities in the peacekeeping operations , ensuring that effective support is rendered in a timely and economical manner .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
In the open and informal consultations held last Thursday at the request of the special coordinator on improved and effective functioning of the Conference , the distinguished representative of Sri Lanka , Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam , we noted the very active participation of delegations .  
Noting that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Supports the Declaration on the Right to Development and underlines the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
In designing the global legal framework against terrorism , the complexity and scope of the definition of terrorism should not and must not hinder the international communitys adoption of urgent , practical and effective measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for their perpetrators .  
Mr . Kerim ( the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) : Pleading for concerted action against international terrorism and for States urgent accession to all relevant international conventions , the Millennium Summit of world leaders anticipated the need for a more effective and comprehensive approach with regard to joint efforts and overall cooperation within the United Nations system .  
That is why we fully agreed with the Chilean representative when , on behalf of the countries of the Rio Group , he stated the firm conviction that measures should be adopted that will contribute to an effective and gradual limitation and monitoring of defence costs in the region , ultimately ensuring the availability of more resources for the social and economic development of our peoples .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
Kyrgyzstan would like to see the future Afghanistan as a peaceful , neutral and friendly State and also holds the view that it is necessary to ensure in that country the international conditions needed for carrying out the Afghan settlement process on a peaceful basis and achieving national reconciliation by setting up a broad-based , effective coalition government that reflects the interests of the entire Afghan people and maintains good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring States .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Invites the Secretary-General , the Economic and Social Council , the Commission for Social Development , the regional commissions , the relevant agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums , within their respective mandates , to take on a priority basis and in a coordinated manner all steps necessary to ensure the effective implementation of all commitments and undertakings contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action and in the further initiatives for social development , and to continue to be actively involved in their follow-up ;  
Reaffirms that a strong political commitment by the international community is needed to implement strengthened and effective international cooperation and assistance for development , including social development , that the mobilization of domestic and international resources for development from all sources is an essential component of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action and of the further initiatives for social development ;  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
It must be recalled here that the loyal and effective commitment of States to general and complete disarmament must serve to assist their access to sophisticated technology designed for peaceful purposes , with due respect for their choices linked to social and economic development .  
The World Summit on Sustainable Development would give the international community a unique opportunity to undertake a holistic and realistic assessment of the real challenges in the field of sustainable development and devise effective means to meet those challenges .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The establishment of an effective , functioning government administration was fundamental to the comprehensive mandate given to UNTAET under Security Council resolution 1272 ( 1999 ) , and is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
The Secretariat , which shared responsibility for the effective functioning of the Organization , should strive for efficiency by improving its billing system : the ability of States to meet the 30-day payment window for peacekeeping assessments would be greatly enhanced if the Secretariat provided an indicative schedule of assessment dates . 
An effective and safe communications infrastructure is essential for the Tribunal : pouch services ; an enhanced communications service , including Internet ; enhanced telephone / fax services to distribute incoming documents on urgent and confidential matters more quickly and safely ; and for connecting off-site locations to the central system .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Call upon all States , consistent with applicable international standards , to take or continue to take measures to strengthen asylum and render protection more effective including through the adoption and implementation of national refugee legislation and procedures for the determination of refugee status and for the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees , giving special attention to vulnerable groups and individuals with special needs , including women , children and the elderly ;  
Relying on social strengths , resorting to legal , administrative , economic and educational means , and adopting a holistic approach were all effective ways to tackle the problem of illicit drugs .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , [ 9 ] and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Also reiterates its call upon the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote the mobilization of adequate technical assistance and funding and to enhance the effectiveness and the full utilization of existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
Informal processes may take various forms , ranging from a completely informal process based upon non-binding principles which support a collective negotiating framework and do not involve the judicial system ( although relying on the existence of an efficient and effective formal system for leverage ) , to those which utilize a judicial administration mechanism to enforce a plan reached by informal negotiations and to bind creditors to that plan .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening the international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ;  
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
This paper has attempted to show that it is possible , and indeed essential , to ensure that the globalization process and the concomitant development of international standards become an effective instrument for poverty reduction and for uplifting the economic and social standing of the most deprived sectors of society .  
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .  
Acknowledges that the establishment of an effective and functioning governmental administration is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment in East Timor , and in this regard urges the international community to continue to support efforts aimed at institution-building and training of civil servants , in particular in the areas of public finances , the judiciary , senior management and the development and maintenance of the central administrative systems of government ;

Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation on adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Regret that , although the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region have made progress in promoting a more favourable environment for technology transfer and for new clean , energy-efficient approaches to production together with the corresponding technical knowledge particularly through the establishment of suitable systems for the protection of intellectual property , the developed countries have not adopted effective measures for ensuring transfers of , in particular , the most appropriate technologies in terms of environmental , social and economic sustainability .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To call for steps to be taken at the Summit to be held in Johannesburg to foster the establishment of effective means of facilitating technology transfer and new approaches to production under more favourable conditions , in keeping with principle 9 of the Rio Declaration , based , in particular , on the establishment by developed countries of financial mechanisms and preferential forms of tax treatment .  
To promote integrated basin management , with emphasis on cross-sectoral , decentralized management conducted from an ecosystemic vantage point , and a change in the culture and in the social perception of the value of water ; and to align economic and market mechanisms with the increasing degree of scarcity by adopting indirect instruments to supplement direct regulation and achieve the effective management and conservation of water resources .  
To emphasize that the achievement of sustainable development and the improvement of the quality of life will require more effective integration of environmental , social and economic components of public policies , programmes and projects at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,
