Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
As the music began , a young lass who looked no older than 16 came onto the stage and sang . She appeared to be unfamiliar and slightly clumsy with her dance steps , and her singing often fell behind the beat . The experienced hostess demonstrated to her how to wriggle her hips , at the same time helping her out by taking up the song where the girl lost track of her place .  
In his university days , Liu Chao-neng took part in a social club at Chung-Yuan Christian University which published a magazine , and he helped organize a Logical Thinking Camp and an Environmental Living Camp . He also studied legislative procedure , joined in the student movement and demonstrated against the aging " perpetual parliamentarians " then still in office .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
In response to questions raised by conservationists both in Taiwan and abroad , COA vice chairman Lee Jen-chyuan stated that this has been a painful experience , and demonstrated that the management of wildlife preserves had to be further improved . Lee also expressed the hope that the incident would encourage the people of Taiwan to give more thought to conservation .  
According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide . Moreover , Dr . George Brown , a fellow of the British Academy , stresses that the experience of loss events also plays a decisive role as a catalyst for suicide .  
The MSI research demonstrated that promising entrepreneurs can be identified and trained , and based on the results of this research MSI developed a compact , costeffective , training programme for identifying and developing local sources of entrepreneurship .  
The foregoing review has demonstrated the vital importance of groundwater whether confined or not , as a source of fresh water for both human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use .  
Both sides demonstrated a sincere concern to resolve the complex set of political , military , humanitarian and socioeconomic problems arising from the political confrontation and civil war in the Republic of Tajikistan .  
Mr . MARTENS ( Federal Republic of Germany ) said that the need for detailed rules of humanitarian law , unnecessary in an ideal world , had been clearly demonstrated by the recent escalation of internal and international armed conflicts .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
My proposal to the Assembly is to create an international United Nations fair-play prize to be awarded every year to the student athlete who , in the judgement of a special committee , has acted most in a spirit of generosity and solidarity with his or her team-mates and competitors and demonstrated the true meaning of fair play in student sporting events throughout the year . 
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
Sudan 's multidimensional cooperation with the international community as represented by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations in ensuring the flow of humanitarian assistance has been the subject of special appreciation by the United Nations as demonstrated in General Assembly resolutions and in the Secretary-General 's report which underscores the success of OLS in assisting all the needy .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Moreover , as has been demonstrated in Nepal , while such benefits may be enjoyed within the country itself , many benefits from conservation are realized outside the country 's borders in forms as diverse as reduced flooding because of the protection of upland forests , the supply of medicinal plants and genetic material , or the pleasure given to international tourists .  
The Angolan people , in turn , demonstrated their acceptance of the objectives of that Agreement by participating enthusiastically and in an orderly manner in the legislative and presidential elections of 29 and 30 September 1992 , considered free and fair by the international community . 
The past decade demonstrated that by expanding opportunities for women , especially in ways that enhance their productivity and income-earning potential , women will be able to raise their standard of living , thereby contributing to improved family well-being and the reduction and eradication of poverty , as well as to better national economic performance .  
In the letter of 10 February from its President addressed to the Secretary-General ( S / 1995 / 130 ) and its presidential statement of 10 February ( S / PRST / 1995 / 7 ) , the Security Council demonstrated its continued concern and , above all , its readiness to support additional practical measures and efforts that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Rwanda .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
First and foremost , the United Nations must be seen to be " speaking with one voice " - hence , the crucial importance of demonstrated leadership by the Secretary-General , clearly recognized and accepted by the other involved elements of the United Nations system and reflected in the overarching strategic framework presented to the donor community .  
By the horrifying indiscriminate mass artillery and missile bombardment of predominantly civilian targets in all the towns of Serb Krajina , Croatia unambiguously demonstrated that one of its main goals , apart from imposing its sovereignty over Krajina , was to inflict heavy losses on the civilian population and by so doing incite a mass exodus of Serbs in order to create an ethnically pure Croat state .  
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
Mr . KUZNETSOV ( Russian Federation ) expressed his delegation 's sincere gratitude to the Chairman for her efforts to resolve a complex matter , and commended the flexibility and constructive attitude demonstrated by Portugal and Belarus . The relocation of Belarus from group B to group C corrected one of the current system 's more obvious and inequitable anomalies .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
By the middle of 1990 , the First Group , with continued foreign assistance , had developed designs and had fabricated and tested a small series of prototype centrifuge machines incorporating carbon fibre rotors and magnetic bearings , the final version of which had a demonstrated capacity of the order of 2 kg separative work units ( SWU ) per year .  
was confident that the required support would be forthcoming and was optimistic about the outcome of the Conference , given the political support demonstrated thus far by national and local governments , organizations and people at all levels of society .  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
During the period when Sarajevo was being reunited under Federation control , the quick impact fund provided virtually the only source of immediate funding for projects aimed at repairing vital communications and transport links and utility supplies , and reviving municipal services .  The quick impact fund also demonstrated the commitment of the international community to a unified , multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Sarajevo by expeditiously funding a variety of projects for all communities .  
Apart from considering substantive issues related to the integration and more active participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system , this meeting also demonstrated the strong will of the above organizations for joint cooperation and a tangible manifestation of complementarity among them .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
The draft resolution demonstrated the international community 's decision to recognize that , at a time of increasing interdependence , the promotion of development called for a constructive dialogue based on mutual interests and benefits , shared responsibility and genuine interdependence .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
These criteria are set out in the current criteria for assignment and promotion published in administrative instruction ST / AI / 413 , which provide , inter alia , that paramount consideration must be given to performance , competence , efficiency and demonstrated potential to perform at the higher level .  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
Among other issues , the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone , distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
With regard to the law that is applicable 29 , the commission held that the general principle that emerges , both from national practice and from international custom , is based on the presumption that the non _ fulfilment of a legal obligation is not justified , except to the extent that it may be demonstrated that it is impossible to proceed othewise than in a manner contrary to the law .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
As a pioneering effort in the region , the Team has demonstrated extraordinary merit and extensive reach of influence and effects throughout the region , inspiring replication of approach and encouraging a broad sector of combined government and civil society participation . 
Acting on the basis of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on friendship , cooperation and mutual assistance between Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia of 13 April 1993 , the Declaration on the prospects for the development of cooperation and common approaches to questions of international relations , signed on 10 January 1995 , and the Declaration on the intensification of the partnership relationship between Ukraine and Georgia , signed in Kiev on 14 February 1997 , which demonstrated their strong determination and set forth the preconditions for the expansion and intensification of such cooperation ,  
Considering that the cost-effectiveness of space technology applications had been demonstrated in several application domains for improving infrastructures , the participants observed that specific and focused cooperative efforts should be made by international organizations and by national entities to promote the use of appropriate technologies .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
The debate and negotiations that took place during the three sessions of the Working Group held in 1997 covered , in a balanced way , the substantive and diverse issues included in both clusters , and demonstrated the complexity of this process of reform which , despite opposing interests , the vast majority of Member States hope will produce a Security Council that represents the current composition of the Organization and effectively responds to the future challenges of the United Nations .  
The firm resolutions that were adopted by the General Assembly at the time , and the frantic search for peace that followed those events , demonstrated to the intense concern of the international community and its will to spare no effort to achieve a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the conflict .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
On balance the amount of progress achieved is discouraging : the interminable debates that take place in Parliament are repeated in CNE , as demonstrated by the two months required to elect its bureau and the failure to establish regional commissions ( that of Kinshasa was set up in August ) .  
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
By supporting democratically accountable local governments , UNCDF has demonstrated that civil society can be empowered and the local private sector stimulated to participate in poverty reduction .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
Unfortunately , owing to the obvious and open obstruction by some Contact Group members , our endeavour did not ultimately produce the desired effects , although the state delegation demonstrated great cooperativeness by demanding a minimum as regards the protection of the national interests , independence , territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This country has done only what any other sovereign country in the world would have done . 
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
Since the beginning of its existence as an independent nation , the Argentine Republic has demonstrated , through actions by the Government , the firm political determination to exercise its effective sovereignty in the southern territories and maritime areas inherited from Spain .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
This encouragement demonstrated a conscious political will that recognizes the importance of women in this field in particular , based on sound principles whereby equality between men and women is the means and approach adopted and whereby the advancement of women is an eminent objective to be accomplished with the aim of achieving a free and equal society , as is the motivation of women to assume higher political office .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
States in the region demonstrated their growing recognition that refugee problems need to be addressed through the creation of effective legislative and institutional frameworks that are consistent with international standards .  
I do not want to conclude without paying my delegation 's special tribute to the entire staff men and women of UNAMET and all other humanitarian personnel , particularly those who still remain voluntarily and courageously in Dili , for their tireless efforts , devotion and sometimes sacrifices that they have so valiantly demonstrated in the face of an extremely difficult environment throughout the process , since the popular consultation up to now .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
In particular , the initial proposals submitted in response to the programme framework on childrens health indicate a marked improvement in both the quality of the projects received as well as in the level of cooperation demonstrated by entities of the United Nations system in designing joint submissions .  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
It is also demonstrated by our vigorous efforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional wisdom of the past , which sacrificed environmental concerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic growth . 
We have seen that even in times of dire financial strife , this Organization has demonstrated its comparative advantage in attracting international attention and mobilizing a concerted and timely response to the plight of hundreds of thousands worldwide who have had their lives and those of their families shattered simply because of meteorological and seismic forces beyond their control .
