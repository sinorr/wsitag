Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
Advanced cultures are healthy , scientific , progressive , represent the development direction of the future , and promote social development .  They are not decadent , passive , ignorant , or backward , nor do they hinder social development .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
Zhang Jichen reformed this backward commanding and training methods , and organized and established a wireless mobile communication command tower , which replaced handflags with electric waves to give commands , and shortened the time to start off the cars in training by one third .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory provides the initial answer to a series of basic questions about how to develop socialism in such a country with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions as China around the primary theoretic subject of " what is socialism and how to development socialism " .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
The question as to which language is superior and which inferior is meaningless .  Dialects , like languages , differ from standard language in that they are used in a certain area ; they are spoken languages of an area and absolutely should not be considered low-class or backward , and they meet the requirements of day-to-day personnel exchanges in certain areas .  
In 1950-1954 , armaments good for equipping 22 aviation divisions and 64 infantry divisions were purchased from the Soviet Union , with much of the purchased armaments reaching advanced international standards of that time , resulting in an tremendous improvement in the backward state of our armed forces ' armaments and thus laying a solid material foundation for prevailing in the war .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
The founding of new China abolished the reactionary rule of imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucratic capitalism and once and for all put an end to China 's wretched circumstances , a country going downhill , poor , backward , internally divided and externally being trampled upon by the powers .  The Chinese people becamethe masters of the new country , new society .  Erasing the humiliation of a century , the Chinese people stood tall among the ranks of nations .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
The western region 's economy is relatively backward , and even for the provincial cities , their economies and tertiary industry are still underdeveloped .  In particular , the troops that are stationed in the tough remote areas practically have no means to set up any kind of society-based safeguard .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
Meanwhile , upholding the principle of developing weapons and equipment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner , the Russian armed forces are developing currently relatively backward weapon and equipment programs , such as communication systems for field operations , automatic systems , and reconnaissance systems in order to enable the general level of weapons and equipment always maintain its leading position in the world .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom has unceasingly carried out splittist and sabotage activities beyond our borders after betraying the motherland and Tibetan people in 1959 .  He not only has not done a single good deed for the Tibetan people but instead has jeopardized Tibet 's social stability and economic development and even resorted to every trick to thwart aid projects arranged and implemented by the World Bank and other organizations for Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the country .  
Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
Full development of the socialist economy will lay a solid foundation for resolving the contradiction between the backward social productivity and the growing material and cultural needs .  
In the view of sociology , no country or nation has a tradition , custom , daily life habit or style of living that will remain forever unchangeable .  Everything will change with economic and social development and change in people 's concept .  It is the law governing the course of history that fine customs compatible with social progress will be preserved while the backward habits that impede social progress will be discarded .  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
Would they not have ended up just like the Chinese today : poor , backward , ignorant , and rough ? "  When she paid homage to Yasukuni Jinjia herself , she shamelessly said : " I think it was deeply regrettable that Japan was defeated in World War II . In particular , that China became the victor was very unfair and very absurd . "  
Since the Communist Party of China was founded , the Chinese nation has undergone a tremendous change from being poor and backward to thriving and prosperous , from being in a state of broken pieces to unity of a high degree , and from being subjected to bullying and humiliation to standing firm among the nations in the world .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
To fundamentally resolve the problem of excess aggregate supply , the SETC , upon approval by the State Council , published relevant measures and took great pains to rectify and shut down a number of small , technologically backward plants and mines that wasted resources , produced shoddy products , caused serious pollution , and failed to conform to the basic requirements of safe production , laying stress on the coal , oil refining , metallurgical , cement , glass , and sugar manufacturing industries .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .

The Ministry is adopting economic , technological and legal means , as well as the necessary administrative means , to control the total domestic transport capacity .  It supports and encourages the use of standardized , serialized and modern vessels on inland rivers .  Through relevant legislation , it will gradually take compulsory measures to eliminate cement vessels , wooden vessels , motor row boats , technological backward vessels , old vessels , and barges towed in tandem .  
The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
The work of moving enterprises from the dam area must be closely combined with economic and enterprise restructuring ; enterprises which produce backward products , which have obsolete plant , which pollute the environment , which wreck resources , and whose assets can not cover their debts must be closed down or declared bankrupt according to the procedure , as appropriate ; they absolutely can not be resettled in their current state .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
In particular , the implementation of measures designed to exercise aggregate control , readjust the economic structure , close down " five kinds of small enterprises , " and eliminate the backward productive capacity has played an important role in pushing for a rebound in industrial efficiency .  
The meeting held that in theoretical work , it is necessary to stress the main theme , take the initiative , scientifically and vividly publicize Marxism , and lead the cadres and masses to continually overcome and resist the influence and erosion of wrong , backward , and corrupt ideological education .  
The PBOC and the State Economic and Trade Commission recently issued a joint circular demanding that all commercial banks limit or halt loans to obsolete and backward production capacity , crafts , and products , and to duplicate construction projects .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
In the metallurgical industry , after further implementing the principle of " closing down small enterprises , eliminating the backward , and restricting the output of oversupplied products , " the profits realized by 93 key large and medium metallurgical enterprises totaled 6.44 billion yuan .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : " Closing coal pits and reducing production " and eliminating backward production capacity are aimed at creating external conditions for helping Datong Coal Mine end deficits and eliminate difficulties .  In addition , this is also an essential requirement for Shanxi Province to adjust economic structure , raise economic efficiency , and improve the ecological environment , and is an important link for successfully running state-owned key coal enterprises .  We must be determined to firmly grasp this work well .  
The same justice official stated that China needs to reform the backward judge training system , to improve judges ' quality , to perfect the system to raise judges ' quality , to put in place a rational and highly efficient training mechanism , so as to ensure smooth and in-depth carrying out of judicial reforms , judicial fairness , and to lay a foundation for nurturing talent .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
While avoiding project duplication and prohibiting the transfer of backward technology and without causing environmental pollution , we shall take strong measures in a number of areas including investment , budgeting , taxation , credit , trade , industry and commerce , labor , and statistics to support enterprises in east and central China in pursuing cooperation with the west by investing in and building factories in the west , buying shares in western enterprises , acquiring or merging with western enterprises , and transferring technology to western enterprises .  
He pointed out that China 's national tradition regards " peace as precious , " and even when China becomes powerful in the future , it will always be a major factor and force for world peace ; it is a happy event for the world that China is rich and strong , on the other hand , if China is always poor and backward , that would be a great calamity for the world .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
By leaping development , we mean a development mode or process in which the backward countries or regions , in order to rapidly narrow their gap with the developed countries or regions under specific circumstances , draw on and assimilate the advanced experiences and fine achievements of the latter and , through unbalanced propulsion and supernormal growth , bring about a leap of the overall level of economic development .  
Municipal , district , county , township and town governments and all social circles should continue to increase the effectiveness of supporting and protecting agriculture .  In particular , while changing the backward conditions of the rural infrastructure facilities and improving the farming production conditions , it is necessary to give policy guidance to the peasants , encouraging them to become main investors and operators in the farming industry , and thus enlivening the rural economy as a whole .  
Therefore , not only must we not engage in low-standard , blind , and redundant constructions , but we must also eliminate backward productive capability to form the mechanism that allows the superior to eliminate the inferior and in turn achieve vertical elevation of the economy 's overall quality .  
For the vast interior areas , especially for most interior provinces and cities restricted by their unfavorable geographical environment and backward economic conditions , Hong Kong is definitely an " aircraft carrier " and also a fleet with huge power .  The fleet is composed of enterprises of different sizes from huge corporations , to medium-sized companies and small-sized businesses .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .  
But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
Recent and distressing events have proven once again that nations and their constituent populations are capable of confronting each other , in the context of unheard-of violence and brutality , on the pretext of the most primitive and backward ideologies based on perverted and totally obsolete concepts and ideas of race or ethnicity . 
One representative considered that , while making the establishment of a fact finding commission compulsory represented a step forward , the optional character of recourse to conciliation constituted a step backward with respect to the conventions on codification concluded in recent decades .  266 .  Another representative was of the view that a rule for a compulsory fact-finding commission comprising three members reflected the need for a comprehensive and compulsory dispute settlement procedure .  
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
The latter includes establishing appropriate national policies and legal instruments ; protection of indigenous lands from environmentally unsound activities ; recognition of indigenous values , knowledge and resource management practices ; development of national dispute settlement arrangements ; and enhancement of capacity-building for indigenous communities .  Key : forward ; backward ; unchanged ; ? unclear .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
One approach is to reduce traditional backward and forward linkages to the local economy to a minimum by not promoting economic growth and its attendant service and administrative infrastructure at the site of production .  
In addition , removing pregnancy and maternity benefits from a social insurance scheme and placing them under the Law on Social Care at a level below the minimum standard of living was a major step backward from the previous arrangement .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
Despite the widely publicized habit of labelling the battles after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan as a civil war , it can be attested on clear evidence that these wars were staged by the short-sighted and injudicious leaders of Pakistan , as the prime factors and instigators of instability in both Central and South Asia , who , in collaboration with backward and obscurantist elements , pursued their expansionist objectives in Afghanistan .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
Advanced cultures are healthy , scientific , progressive , represent the development direction of the future , and promote social development .  They are not decadent , passive , ignorant , or backward , nor do they hinder social development .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
Zhang Jichen reformed this backward commanding and training methods , and organized and established a wireless mobile communication command tower , which replaced handflags with electric waves to give commands , and shortened the time to start off the cars in training by one third .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory provides the initial answer to a series of basic questions about how to develop socialism in such a country with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions as China around the primary theoretic subject of " what is socialism and how to development socialism " .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
The question as to which language is superior and which inferior is meaningless .  Dialects , like languages , differ from standard language in that they are used in a certain area ; they are spoken languages of an area and absolutely should not be considered low-class or backward , and they meet the requirements of day-to-day personnel exchanges in certain areas .  
In 1950-1954 , armaments good for equipping 22 aviation divisions and 64 infantry divisions were purchased from the Soviet Union , with much of the purchased armaments reaching advanced international standards of that time , resulting in an tremendous improvement in the backward state of our armed forces ' armaments and thus laying a solid material foundation for prevailing in the war .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
The founding of new China abolished the reactionary rule of imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucratic capitalism and once and for all put an end to China 's wretched circumstances , a country going downhill , poor , backward , internally divided and externally being trampled upon by the powers .  The Chinese people becamethe masters of the new country , new society .  Erasing the humiliation of a century , the Chinese people stood tall among the ranks of nations .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
The western region 's economy is relatively backward , and even for the provincial cities , their economies and tertiary industry are still underdeveloped .  In particular , the troops that are stationed in the tough remote areas practically have no means to set up any kind of society-based safeguard .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
Meanwhile , upholding the principle of developing weapons and equipment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner , the Russian armed forces are developing currently relatively backward weapon and equipment programs , such as communication systems for field operations , automatic systems , and reconnaissance systems in order to enable the general level of weapons and equipment always maintain its leading position in the world .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom has unceasingly carried out splittist and sabotage activities beyond our borders after betraying the motherland and Tibetan people in 1959 .  He not only has not done a single good deed for the Tibetan people but instead has jeopardized Tibet 's social stability and economic development and even resorted to every trick to thwart aid projects arranged and implemented by the World Bank and other organizations for Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the country .  
Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
Full development of the socialist economy will lay a solid foundation for resolving the contradiction between the backward social productivity and the growing material and cultural needs .  
In the view of sociology , no country or nation has a tradition , custom , daily life habit or style of living that will remain forever unchangeable .  Everything will change with economic and social development and change in people 's concept .  It is the law governing the course of history that fine customs compatible with social progress will be preserved while the backward habits that impede social progress will be discarded .  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .

Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .

In particular , that China became the victor was very unfair and very absurd . "  
Since the Communist Party of China was founded , the Chinese nation has undergone a tremendous change from being poor and backward to thriving and prosperous , from being in a state of broken pieces to unity of a high degree , and from being subjected to bullying and humiliation to standing firm among the nations in the world .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .

We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .

It supports and encourages the use of standardized , serialized and modern vessels on inland rivers .  Through relevant legislation , it will gradually take compulsory measures to eliminate cement vessels , wooden vessels , motor row boats , technological backward vessels , old vessels , and barges towed in tandem .  
The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
The work of moving enterprises from the dam area must be closely combined with economic and enterprise restructuring ; enterprises which produce backward products , which have obsolete plant , which pollute the environment , which wreck resources , and whose assets can not cover their debts must be closed down or declared bankrupt according to the procedure , as appropriate ; they absolutely can not be resettled in their current state .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .

The PBOC and the State Economic and Trade Commission recently issued a joint circular demanding that all commercial banks limit or halt loans to obsolete and backward production capacity , crafts , and products , and to duplicate construction projects .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .

The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
While avoiding project duplication and prohibiting the transfer of backward technology and without causing environmental pollution , we shall take strong measures in a number of areas including investment , budgeting , taxation , credit , trade , industry and commerce , labor , and statistics to support enterprises in east and central China in pursuing cooperation with the west by investing in and building factories in the west , buying shares in western enterprises , acquiring or merging with western enterprises , and transferring technology to western enterprises .

Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
By leaping development , we mean a development mode or process in which the backward countries or regions , in order to rapidly narrow their gap with the developed countries or regions under specific circumstances , draw on and assimilate the advanced experiences and fine achievements of the latter and , through unbalanced propulsion and supernormal growth , bring about a leap of the overall level of economic development .  
Municipal , district , county , township and town governments and all social circles should continue to increase the effectiveness of supporting and protecting agriculture .  In particular , while changing the backward conditions of the rural infrastructure facilities and improving the farming production conditions , it is necessary to give policy guidance to the peasants , encouraging them to become main investors and operators in the farming industry , and thus enlivening the rural economy as a whole .  
Therefore , not only must we not engage in low-standard , blind , and redundant constructions , but we must also eliminate backward productive capability to form the mechanism that allows the superior to eliminate the inferior and in turn achieve vertical elevation of the economy 's overall quality .  
For the vast interior areas , especially for most interior provinces and cities restricted by their unfavorable geographical environment and backward economic conditions , Hong Kong is definitely an " aircraft carrier " and also a fleet with huge power .  The fleet is composed of enterprises of different sizes from huge corporations , to medium-sized companies and small-sized businesses .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .  
But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities .

Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
Recent and distressing events have proven once again that nations and their constituent populations are capable of confronting each other , in the context of unheard-of violence and brutality , on the pretext of the most primitive and backward ideologies based on perverted and totally obsolete concepts and ideas of race or ethnicity . 
One representative considered that , while making the establishment of a fact finding commission compulsory represented a step forward , the optional character of recourse to conciliation constituted a step backward with respect to the conventions on codification concluded in recent decades .  266 .  Another representative was of the view that a rule for a compulsory fact-finding commission comprising three members reflected the need for a comprehensive and compulsory dispute settlement procedure .  
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
The latter includes establishing appropriate national policies and legal instruments ; protection of indigenous lands from environmentally unsound activities ; recognition of indigenous values , knowledge and resource management practices ; development of national dispute settlement arrangements ; and enhancement of capacity-building for indigenous communities .  Key : forward ; backward ; unchanged ; ? unclear .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
One approach is to reduce traditional backward and forward linkages to the local economy to a minimum by not promoting economic growth and its attendant service and administrative infrastructure at the site of production .  
In addition , removing pregnancy and maternity benefits from a social insurance scheme and placing them under the Law on Social Care at a level below the minimum standard of living was a major step backward from the previous arrangement .

Despite the widely publicized habit of labelling the battles after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan as a civil war , it can be attested on clear evidence that these wars were staged by the short-sighted and injudicious leaders of Pakistan , as the prime factors and instigators of instability in both Central and South Asia , who , in collaboration with backward and obscurantist elements , pursued their expansionist objectives in Afghanistan .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .
