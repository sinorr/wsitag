The fundamental reason why he degenerated from a senior cadre into a corrupt element and a criminal against the people is that he abandoned the program of serving the people and the ideals and beliefs of a communist , harbored different ambitions from the party , and was greedy for power , money , and sex , and his selfish desires swelled up to a tremendous degree .  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the ï¿½t hree represents .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that positively pushing forward the strategic economic structural adjustment is a fundamental measure to give impetus to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and elevate the quality and efficiency of the economic growth .

A summary of contents : - - The fundamental reason for the Communist Party of China [ CPC ] being powerful lies in her always upholding carrying forward and bringing into play the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation , walking in the front row of social developments , listening to the intentions and appeals of the masses of people , and constantly realizing their wishes and demands , thus always maintaining the advanced nature of vanguards of the Chinese working class .  
However , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
In other words , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but is historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
As long as our party always becomes the faithful representative of the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China our party can always establish itself in an unassailable position , always enjoy the heartfelt support of the people of all nationalities in the whole country , and lead the people to constantly forge ahead .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
Representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people are closely interrelated and can embody the essential needs of socialism .  Of these three , the overriding one is representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
The establishment and development of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership is a historically correct choice and a sacred mission entrusted to us by the times .  It is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples and helps promote the course of multipolarization in the world and establish a just and rational new international order .  
However , from the Syrian perspective , whether or not the future border between the two countries is able to be drawn according to the pre-1967 Six Day War actual line of control has a vital bearing on their national dignity and territorial integrity , as well as whether or not they can solve the significant fundamental problems with the half-century old continued Arab Israeli conflict .  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .  They should also establish effective mechanisms to ban the practice of journalists getting personal gains in the guise of making journalistic reports so as to truly fundamentally separate news-covering , editing , and reporting activities from commercial activities .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
We are glad to see the smooth progress made in the relations between the two parties and two countries since the normalization of Vietnamese-Chinese ties .  In particular , the framework of a " comprehensive and cooperative relationship based on good-neighborliness and friendship and oriented toward the 21st century " between Vietnam and China agreed upon by the leaders of both countries a year ago is completely in keeping with the fundamental interests of both countries and the common aspirations of the two peoples .  
Our stand of opposing " Taiwan independence " has won the support of all the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots , and met with general approval in the international community .  It has also hit the sore point of " Taiwan independence " elements .  Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
During President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan in 1998 , he jointly formulated with Japanese leaders the fundamental policy on developing Japanese-Chinese ties gearing toward the future .  It indicated that Japanese-Chinese ties entered a new phase , and that both countries have established bilateral ties which were varied and mutually interdependent .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after another .  There is not yet a fundamental change in the unfair and inequitable old international political and economic order .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Just as our Army building is entering the new millenium , the Central Military Commission has promulgated the Essentials for Reform and Development of Military Universities and Schools , describing a grand blueprint regarding the reforms and development of our military universities and schools at the beginning of the 21st century , and setting forth the preconditions for the prosperous development of military education in the future .  It is a project of fundamental significance to the long-term flourishing of the national defense effort and to the military 's development .  
Ideological-political work and economic construction must be grasped simultaneously .  This is our party 's consistent policy , which reflects the dialectical unity between economic foundation and superstructure and gives expression to the fundamental need of balanced development of material and spiritual civilization and all-round social progress .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
During a recent inspection of work in Liaoning , CPC Political Bureau Standing member and State Council Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that a social security system that is independent from enterprises and institutions is an important cornerstone of a socialist market economy system , and that accelerating the development of such a system is a matter of fundamental importance for deepening reforms , stabilizing society , and running the state well and ensuring national security , so we must do a good job of this important matter which has a bearing on the overall situation . 
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
So long as our party can loyally represent at all times the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party can always remain at an invincible position , can always win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to forge forward on a constant basis . "  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
has reiterated the principal position of the masses of the people , as well as our fundamental aim in bringing about a social , economic , and cultural development ; and has further straightened the relationship that the party should act as a " public servant " to the people .  This is a continued adherence and a new development to the party building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
So long as it always becomes a loyal representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces , the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
In the past two decades since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country 's overall national power has significantly strengthened , people 's living standard has been constantly improved and our international position had been greatly raised .  The most fundamental reason is due to the rapid and healthy economic and social development .  
So long as it is conducive to protecting the people 's fundamental interests , to economic construction and social stability , to punishing corruption and crimes , and to promoting close ties between the party and the masses , we should actively explore ways , be bold in taking actions and brave in finding new ways and achieve breakthroughs .  We should proceed from doing a good job in our own place , own department and own unit ;  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
" fundamental " means that once the scientific method is established , it will become the soul of the individual , the nation and the people .  It will stimulate the people to love life , to pursue truth , and to be intelligent and sharp , to be fair and unselfish , to be self-confident , not cocky , to be rigorous , not picky , to be upright and outspoken , calm and unhurried , to be filled with the spirit of creativity and creative vitality .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
With only three years of effort , a common automotive technician has become a " missile expert " The road that Xu Guangfeng has covered is but a detailed embodiment of the pioneering spirit with which officers and soldiers of our military have been trying hard to realize the " two fundamental changes " . 
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
Recently , Comrade Jiang Zemin stated that our party must always be the loyal representative that meets the requirements for development of advanced social productive forces of China , that is in line with the development trend of China 's advanced culture , and that is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
These provisions on the basis of reviewing our militarys experiences in information security and confidentiality in the new situation and learning positive practices from foreign countries and foreign military forces not only provide explicit requirements on some crucial issues , but also systematically specify the basic principle , duty and authorization , preventative measures and administrative procedures regarding information security and confidentiality .  These provisions are the fundamental basis for further strengthening the work of information security and confidentiality throughout the military as a whole .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Provided that our party remains the requirement of the development of advanced social productivity in China , the way forward for advanced culture in China and the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , it will always be invincible , will always have the heartfelt support of all ethnic groups throughout the country and will be able to lead the masses in pressing ahead incessantly .  
The thinking of " three represents , " with its profound meaning expressed in simple and concise language , is a new summary of the party 's nature , aim and fundamental tasks .  It is a new development of the Marxist theory of party building and a new requirement placed by the new situation on party organizations and party cadres at all levels .  It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
You Dexin emphasized that the motherland of Mainland China upholds several fundamental principles for the development of cross-strait economic relations : " direct and two-way , reciprocal and mutually beneficial , diverse , stable and long-term and adhering to agreements . "  Mainland China is completely in accord with the aims and spirit of the WTO .  
This is a major strategic disposition made by the party Central Committee and the State Council in light of the grim situation in public order currently facing China . It embodies a strong desire of the broad masses of the people and represents the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .

Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
Speaking of China 's foreign policies , President Jiang stressed : Maintaining independence and keeping the initiative are the most salient characteristics of China 's diplomacy .  On various international issues , China has all along formulated her policies or positions by constantly proceeding from the fundamental , long-term interests of the Chinese people and the people the world over , and in light of right and wrong in specific issues as well .  
Both sides indicate that it is an important choice made by China and Belarus in the face of changes in the international situation in the new century and is in the fundamental and long-term interests of both China and Belarus to deepen Sino-Belarussian comprehensive friendly relations and cooperation built on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , a high degree of trust , and combined efforts and to raise them to an entirely new level .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Comrade Wang Wei had broad revolutionary ideals and the spirit of lofty dedication ; he practiced our army 's fundamental purpose in model fashion , and faithfully carried out our army 's basic function ; he is an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary servicemen .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
Leading comrades from the State Council pointed out that basic education is the cornerstone of the strategy of vitalizing the country through science and education .  Its significance for improving the quality of the Chinese nation , nurturing qualified personnel of all types at all levels , and promoting socialist modernization is as broad as it is fundamental .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
Although water conservation work has been constantly strengthened , flood prevention capacities of major rivers in our country have been increased , and the flood prevention standards for these rivers have been raised in recent years , no fundamental change has been made in the weak foundation of flood prevention projects across the country , and risky sections of dikes and dams as well as risky reservoirs remain to be serious potential dangers in flood prevention .  
Administration according to law is an important style of modern administration , is an effective way of solving complex contradictions confronting us at present , and is also the fundamental requirement for building a clean and honest , diligent , pragmatic , and highly efficient government .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .  This not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples but also conducive to promoting the process of a multi-polar world and to building a new , just , and rational international political and economic order .  
However , contrary to what the author expects , it is entirely legal and logical for the National People 's Congress to interpret laws in accordance with the principle of " one country , two systems " .  Further , the interpretation of the law has helped safeguard the dignity of the Basic Law and laid a foundation for Hong Kong 's long-term prosperity and stability .  It is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people , and it has won the understanding and support of the vast number of Hong Kong citizens .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
The signing of the treaty not only will reflect the common desire of the two peoples for friendship from generation to generation , but also will show the development of friendly , comprehensive and mutually beneficial [ you hao quan mian hu li ] relations between China and Russia conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples , and is conducive to maintaining regional and world peace , stability and development .  
Reviewing and summarizing the glorious 80-year history of our party , we have come to a more profound understanding that always integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the concrete practice of China 's revolution and construction , always firmly relying on the millions of people to acquire endless motive force for progress , and always comprehensively strengthening and improving party building in line with the party 's central task constitute the basic experience for our party to conquer hardships , maintain vigor , and make progress continuously .  
He pointed out that the fundamental reason why the CPC has been able during its 80-year career to unite and lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to win victory after victory and overcome one danger and obstacle after another is that we have consistently integrated the basic principles of Marxism with China 's specific reality , and have continually explored and upheld the correct road for advance suited to China 's realities in every historical period of revolution , construction , and reform .  
History fully shows that the CPC , which all along represents the development requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , represents the advancing direction of China 's advanced culture , and represents the fundamental interests of the broadest Chinese people , is worthy of the title of a great , glorious , and correct party .  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
During those warring years , the reason for the strength of the party growing from small to big , the propositions of the party conforming with the popular feelings , and the armed forces of the party developing like a single spark starting a prairie fire was because the party regarded doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses in doing everything as its fundamental line .  As it could fulfill what it said and represented the fundamental interests of the people , it won the hearts of the people .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .

Second , in order to expand domestic demand , should give 900-million farmers priority in benefiting from infrastructure investment that the state should be making in the countryside , including increasing road networks , water supply networks , electric supply networks , communications networks and radio and television networks between cities and the countryside , as well as inputs for the fundamental construction of farms , water conservancy and the ecological environment in the countryside , absorbing as many temporary farmers as possible and creating more employment opportunities for them .  
While talking about the issue that the party 's leading collective of the third generation has been concerned about the causes of foreign trade and economic cooperation , Shi Guangsheng said with deep emotion that the farsighted and accurate policy decisions of the party Central Committee are the fundamental reason why the cause of foreign trade and economic cooperation is growing more and more prosperous .  
The third generation of the leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to and developed Comrade Xiaoping 's thinking of opening to the outside world and intensified relevant theories and practice .  It has called for the need to expand the scale of opening up further , strive to raise the level of opening up , accelerate the realization of the two fundamental changes , and ceaselessly develop foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
The nationwide support forces for Tibet have expanded , and the state has invested in and constructed a series of fundamental key projects such as transportation , energy , communications , farming , and the animal husbandry industry , as well as other social undertakings .  This has set up a good foundation for long-term development in Tibet .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .

In a word , we must always represent the development needs of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China .

We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .

He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
After China 's entry to the WTO , she will have to act according to the relevant regulations , and with the basic premise of protecting the stability of the renminbi , use a phased liberalization of Chinese domestic capital markets .  This is because the protection of the exchange rate 's fundamental stability is beneficial to the long-term stability of Chinese economic growth .  
Some people close to the issue feel that international and domestic experiences all indicate that social stability is the fundamental guarantee of stable and rapid economic growth , and is also the foundation for a stable exchange rate for a currency .  
This has been proven by practice of fundamental , universal , long duration , great importance , which has a bearing on the long-term development of the party 's cause .  Only when this issue is solved properly , can our party always retain its advanced and revolutionary nature and creativity and can it establish itself in an unassailable position .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The Speech sums up the basic experiences of the CPC over the past 80 years , looks forward to the tremendous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , and profoundly points out that for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must , in sum , always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
3 .  The " speech " uses the " three represents " important idea to sums up history , analyze reality , and look into the future ; reveals the scientific connotation of representing the requirement of the development of the advanced productive forces , the orientation of the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , as well as their inherent relationships ; and uses the " three represents " as a guideline to put forward the basic tasks of stepping up and improving party building .  
With regard to the current issues in China 's management structure , there are three points that merit special attention : First , the contractual relationship between the principal and the agent is not sufficiently distinct , so that the agent does not understand what his functions are in the course of concrete operations , which are chiefly manifested in the failure to resolve such fundamental problems as the indistinct functions between the government and the enterprises and between the party and the enterprises .  
It is entirely in the fundamental interest of the people of Taiwan and the fundamental interest of the Chinese nation for the government and people of China to refuse to commit themselves to renouncing the use of force ; only by achieving the complete unification of China will it be possible to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and for the Chinese nation to become even more thriving , developed , prosperous , rich , and powerful . 
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .

Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Third , the Basic Law is the HKSAR 's constitutional law that stipulates the various systems and policies practiced in the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems ; the system for safeguarding the residents ' fundamental rights and freedom ; the executive , legislative and judicial systems ;  
Experts say that faced with a new development trend in the world auto industry marked by concentration , development of high and technologies , globalization of management , and by sophisticated production methods , China 's auto industry must develop a modern enterprise system that is adapted to that of foreign developed countries .  Reform , restructuring , and technological innovation are the fundamental way out to raise enterprises ' competitiveness .  
He noted : The one-China principle involves China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and involves the fundamental interests and dignity of the Chinese nation ; and since it is the most precious asset that the people on both sides of the strait have left to their future generations through shedding blood and engaging themselves in hard struggles , the one-China principle enjoys a sacred and inviolable position .

These devious fallacies of fundamental knowledge " preached by Li Hongzhi have taken advantage of the bad phenomenon of people 's hatred for society and their pursuit of livelihood and morality in the good expectations and proper ideological trends of truthfulness , benevolence , and forbearance .

He pointed out that the new leader of the Taiwan authorities adopted an evasive style toward the One China principle in his " inaugural speech " , and lacked this most fundamental point ; all the other pleasant sounding sweet words and blandishments , and the so-called expressions of goodwill , all became scraps of worthless paper , carrying no meaning .  
On cross-strait relations , he attempted to avoid one China , which is " fundamental " and adopted some soft means to strive to create some " obscure and blurred space , " so as to resist the appeal of the mainland motherland for developing cross-strait relations and starting political negotiations under the principle of one China .  
Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .

When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .

But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .

The refugee definition was meant to have an inclusive , rather than a restrictive meaning , in accordance with the fundamental objective of providing international protection to those lacking effective national protection , through the recognition of their refugee status .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .

However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .

It is hard , however , to speak about either a successful and broad application of the educational potential of sport or sporting achievements in a country where the mass aspect of sport one of its fundamental principles has been violated as a result of aggression by the neighbouring Republic of Armenia .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
A fundamental contradiction in the practice of sanctions is that when they are introduced the main foundation is the interest of the international community , but when they are lifted the dominant factor is national interests - sometimes not even genuine ones - on the part of individual States .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the agenda item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " . 
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Demands the immediate and unconditional release of all persons who have not committed crimes against humanity and who are detained or imprisoned as a result of their struggle for self-determination and independence , full respect for their fundamental individual rights and compliance with article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 2 ] / under the terms of which no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
He stressed that it would be desirable to take a more flexible position regarding reservations , since incorporation of the provisions of the statute into national law was bound to raise fundamental issues of constitutional law .  
Recognizing that the growing threat of organized crime , with its highly destabilizing and corrupting influence on fundamental social , economic and political institutions , represents a challenge demanding increased and more effective international cooperation ,  
The need to initiate legislative amendments to reduce the almost indiscriminate possession and bearing of arms that now exists , and increased control by the security forces over the illegal possession and bearing of arms and over the entry of unregistered weapons into the country , are considered fundamental aspects of this commitment .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Recalling that in the Charter of the United Nations the peoples of the United Nations declared their determination to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples ,  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reiterating its profound conviction that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Affirms that a primary aim of international cooperation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom , dignity and peace for all peoples and for every human being , that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from promoting and protecting the others ;  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , stresses the need to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and to the return by refugees and displaced persons to their homes , and welcomes in this regard the commitments made by the Government of Rwanda ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ; 
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Recognition of the identity of the indigenous peoples is fundamental to the construction of a national unity based on respect for and the exercise of political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
The leaders of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs advocated the speedy holding in Moscow of the next , fourth , round of inter-Tajik talks , at which the fundamental questions of a political settlement must be discussed in a constructive spirit in accordance with the agenda for the talks agreed upon earlier by the parties .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .

The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .  
The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .  On the contrary , they had helped to advance the fundamental objective of broad participation by States .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
all national and international policies and measures , in particular those of an economic and financial character , should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective " .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .

bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
It is no secret that the North Korean regime relies for its survival on a totalitarian system of control and an anachronistic personality cult , sustained by subjecting its people to a virtual state of slavery , by denying them the most fundamental human rights , by supporting international terrorism and by all the other accompaniments of a failed , rogue State .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
CARICOM was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas on 4 July l973 with the fundamental objectives of , first , promoting and facilitating economic development , thereby improving well-being and reducing poverty and unemployment ; secondly , strengthening and coordinating the interface of the small States of the Caribbean with the international community ; and , third , promoting , through cooperation , social and cultural development and the preservation of these .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
We would have preferred that the draft resolution set down as its principal operative conclusion a firm call on the international community to consider further the fundamental and challenging questions that the advisory opinion poses .  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It was also essential to create conditions for the reconstruction of civil society , particularly for the holding of free and fair elections and for building democratic institutions which would guarantee the rule of law and foster deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Furthermore , as the participants at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen had underscored , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as well the strengthening of democracy within the framework of equitable economic relations and a favourable international economic environment were an integral part of social development .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
SHAH ( India ) said that India , a pluralistic nation with well-established humanistic traditions of tolerance , harmony and non-violence , guaranteed fundamental human rights to all its citizens ; those rights were enforced by an independent judiciary and jealously guarded by a free and vigilant press , an articulate public opinion and a vast network of non-governmental organizations .  
The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .  
On the question of fundamental discrepancies between the constitutional and de facto rights of women , including economic and employment constraints , inadequate social services , inappropriate policies and outmoded stereotypes , she said that article 22 of the Ukrainian Labour Code prohibited gender-based violations of a woman 's right to be hired for work .  
We recognize that access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services is essential to a person 's physical , psychological , social and economic well-being and should be a fundamental part of our urgent actions for the more than 1-billion people without decent living conditions .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Considering that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Recognizing further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
It must be stressed that what we are dealing with here is not only hostile and provocative acts against the Republic of Cuba , as grave and illegal as they are , but also the fact that all the activities carried out by the so-called " Brothers to the Rescue " are violations of the standards which govern international civil aviation and may consequently endanger the lives and safety of many people and aircraft , which it is the fundamental obligation of the International Civil Aviation Organization to protect .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The proper functioning of the law enforcement agencies is essential not only to an effective criminal justice policy , but also to the underlying premise of the protection of the fundamental human rights of individuals .  
According to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the term " discrimination against women " is used to denote all forms of discrimination , deprivation and restriction that prevents or eliminates or aims to prevent or eliminate the recognition , utilization and benefiting of women from all political , economic , social , cultural , civil and other fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings as based on the equality of the sexes and regardless of their civil status .  
" Basic scientific research " : experimental or theoretical work undertaken principally to acquire new knowledge of the fundamental principles of phenomena or observable facts , not primarily directed towards a specific practical aim or objective .  
To promote the fundamental principles of maintenance of the rule of law and good governance and to increase the capacity of States to devise and implement effective , integrated and consolidated strategies and measures at the national level , and to put into effect bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels .  
The abuse of drugs and alcohol is an intrinsic threat to such basic goals as economic and social well-being , fundamental human rights and social justice , constructive development , adequate employment and satisfactory conditions of work and pay .  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
Strengthened by a five-year mandate , the new Government has moved quickly to address the fundamental problems impeding development , such as weak governmental institutions , economic inefficiency and corruption , and has laid out economic policies which seek to stimulate growth and reduce inflation by encouraging domestic investment and job-creating programmes .  
It is the Greek Cypriot side which rejects the set of ideas by putting forward totally unrealistic demands , alien to the negotiating process , with the professed aim of doing away with the Treaty of Guarantee as well as other fundamental elements of a realistic solution , in a transparent attempt to bring about the ultimate Greek domination of Cyprus .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .  NULL  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
As a result of resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , the fundamental rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its 21.3-million people to participate in international political , economic and cultural activities have not been respected and protected in the same way that the rights of peoples of other States have , and the stability in the region of the Taiwan Strait is also threatened .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
The attending Heads of State and Government had received a delegation of the Coordinating Committee of the Diplomatic Front for Timorese Resistance and had reiterated that they were ready to promote concerted action to guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in East Timor and a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution that would achieve respect for the legitimate rights and aspirations of its people in conformity with international law .  
The third conclusion was that the underlying causes of the eruption of violent incidents and episodes had not been removed : political rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be suppressed and religious tensions and the immigration of Indonesians into the Territory were putting in jeopardy the cultural , religious and social identity of East Timor .  
Whenever incidents occurred that were contrary to its firm commitment to uphold and protect basic rights and fundamental freedoms , as had happened in Dili on 12 November 1991 , the Indonesian Government took swift and decisive action to bring to justice those responsible , be they civilians or military personnel . 
This inspiring philosophy required a holistic institution : an organization mandated with responsibility for distinct yet interconnected areas of human activity and the safeguard of agreed and fundamental principles of international behaviour .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
The United Nations will promote necessary measures to strengthen laws , policies and programmes that would ensure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life as equal partners and the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all women .  
It was recognized that respect for the rights of the accused were fundamental and reflected the credibility of the Court and that there was already a large body of international law on the subject , as contained in such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and the statutes of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals , which should be elaborated in the statute .  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . [ 1 ] / United Nations , Treaty Series , vol .  520 , No . 7515 .  
Because of the obstacles experienced and the serious hindrances caused by the Israeli leadership 's failure to respect its commitments , our Council must today face the logical results of such a situation and of the Israeli attitude , which differs greatly from what the international community has set down as the fundamental principles for a peaceful , comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict .  
Having reviewed the steps taken towards the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50 / 145 and 50 / 146 , including other relevant mandates in this area , it can be concluded that the credibility of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme will be measured , to a large extent , by its ability to provide effective support to requesting countries in drafting legislation , creating independent systems for the administration of justice , establishing police forces that are respectful of the rule of law and setting up national institutions for protecting fundamental human rights .  
Nevertheless , there were some problems of a more fundamental nature , such as the facts that full and prompt delivery of revenues was not possible because of late payments by many Member States , that a number of Member States were deliberately violating the obligations entered into under the Charter with regard to the operation of the methodology and that severe imbalances in the distribution of revenue-sourcing were inevitable while so many developing countries continued to be impoverished by the existing economic system .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
Although both texts have been rendered obsolete - re-educational work camps and civic service camps having long since been closed down - they were expressly abrogated by Act No . 95-9 dated 23 January 1995 - evidence of the great importance the Tunisia of the new era attaches to international labour standards , and of its desire to achieve a high degree of harmonization of its legislation with the principles inspired by those standards , and in particular those relating to fundamental human rights . 
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
Since the freedom of creative activity is regarded as a fundamental condition for the development of human rights in science and technology , the national research system , inspired by the Declaration of 7 November 1987 , has endeavoured to encourage the exercise of this freedom by means of an array of legal , administrative , jurisdictional and trade-union measures .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated the continued validity of the fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination , the exercise of which , in the case of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation , is essential to ensure the eradication of all those situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
The ideals that inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago when the community of nations pledged to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
It reaffirmed that democracy and transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society were indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development and that Governments in all countries should promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , bearing in mind the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy , development and respect for human rights , and should make public institutions more responsive to people 's needs .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
On a different level , it is of fundamental importance that places of worship should be reserved for religious , non-political uses , that the legal system governing political parties should be defined in such a way as to avoid political variables impinging on religious constants , and that schools should be protected from all ideological , political or partisan indoctrination .

Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
Secondly , it would require education for solidarity , in order to ensure , as a fundamental prerequisite for collective harmony , the permanent integration of our peoples on a solid basis of personal and national self-esteem , an education in which the principle of shared responsibility is increasingly strengthened in the minds and hearts of citizens .

Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,

The Canberra Commission was a body of independent experts and eminent persons commissioned by the Australian Government to address the fundamental questions of whether a nuclear _ weapon _ free world is feasible and , if so , the measures which could be taken to attain that objective .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
In particular , he stressed the need for fundamental political rights and freedoms to be protected during the electoral campaign , if the elections were to be recognized as free and fair .

A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,

Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "

Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
It should be easy to understand why the Government of the Republic of Burundi objects to the talks being held in the United Republic of Tanzania , the fundamental reason for this objection being the current tension resulting from the problems caused by the refugee camps set up all along the shared border by the United Republic of Tanzania , just a dozen or so kilometres from Burundi , which are regularly used as bases for bloody incursions into Burundi territory . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Acting on the basis of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on friendship , cooperation and mutual assistance between Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia of 13 April 1993 , the Declaration on the prospects for the development of cooperation and common approaches to questions of international relations , signed on 10 January 1995 , and the Declaration on the intensification of the partnership relationship between Ukraine and Georgia , signed in Kiev on 14 February 1997 , which demonstrated their strong determination and set forth the preconditions for the expansion and intensification of such cooperation ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
The world has witnessed fundamental economic changes , such as the end of State control of economic life in many States , the withering away of numerous restraints on international trade , the easy transfer of capital and huge investments across the world .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only three years after the establishment of the United Nations reflected a common understanding that fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity provide the most solid foundation for peace , democracy , development and fruitful international cooperation in every field of human activity .

Indeed , it has now become common practice for the leadership in Addis Ababa to flagrantly violate fundamental principles of international law - whether it is in acts of brazen aggression , human rights violations or blatant incursions against neighbouring countries - and then accuse its victims for the very transgressions that it is guilty of in a pre-emptive , if transparent , manner . 
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .

There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .

Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .

The spirit of the instruments would seem to be clear : the right to education principally concerns personal development , but in cases where this personal development is itself linked to the quality of the relational fabric that the person is able to weave with his or her peers , this fundamental right necessarily takes on a universal dimension , since social or national communities can no longer exist and develop in isolation .

My personal hope is that the projected dialogue of civilizations will eventuate at some future point in a formal statement on human values , not a charter or compact containing strictures that would be formally binding on its signatories , but a statement of fundamental human values that elaborates their bases in belief and thought as understood in different civilizational traditions .  
With regard to the latter decision , the Trial Chamber stated that " [ international humanitarian law ] does not lay down synallagmatic obligations , i.e . obligations based on reciprocity , but obligations erga omnes ( or , in the case of treaty obligations , obligations erga omnes contractantes ) which are designed to safeguard fundamental human values and therefore must be complied with regardless of the conduct of the other party or parties .

The fruit that our peace process has manifestly borne in such a short time provides clear evidence of the validity and relevance of the system and of the fundamental , indispensable and inestimable importance of the efforts of the Guatemalan people within the country and of the unquestionable effectiveness of international friendship in the form of respectful , timely and effective cooperation in building a more democratic country and a more equitable and united world .

The preservation and extension of its achievements , coupled with revitalization of the moral authority and political relevance of the United Nations in the coming millennium , require restoration of the fundamental purposes and principles of the United Nations , as well as a rational , transparent and participatory process of reassessment of the existing institutions .  
The obstacles experienced during the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the United Nations regarding the oil-for-food formula which all reports and realities indicate can not meet the essential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq are striking evidence of the American Administrations insistence on harming the people of Iraq and depriving them of their fundamental humanitarian rights , as enshrined in all international covenants .

During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .

Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
During President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan in 1998 , he jointly formulated with Japanese leaders the fundamental policy on developing Japanese-Chinese ties gearing toward the future .  It indicated that Japanese-Chinese ties entered a new phase , and that both countries have established bilateral ties which were varied and mutually interdependent .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after another .  There is not yet a fundamental change in the unfair and inequitable old international political and economic order .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Just as our Army building is entering the new millenium , the Central Military Commission has promulgated the Essentials for Reform and Development of Military Universities and Schools , describing a grand blueprint regarding the reforms and development of our military universities and schools at the beginning of the 21st century , and setting forth the preconditions for the prosperous development of military education in the future .  It is a project of fundamental significance to the long-term flourishing of the national defense effort and to the military 's development .  
Ideological-political work and economic construction must be grasped simultaneously .  This is our party 's consistent policy , which reflects the dialectical unity between economic foundation and superstructure and gives expression to the fundamental need of balanced development of material and spiritual civilization and all-round social progress .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
During a recent inspection of work in Liaoning , CPC Political Bureau Standing member and State Council Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that a social security system that is independent from enterprises and institutions is an important cornerstone of a socialist market economy system , and that accelerating the development of such a system is a matter of fundamental importance for deepening reforms , stabilizing society , and running the state well and ensuring national security , so we must do a good job of this important matter which has a bearing on the overall situation . 
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
So long as our party can loyally represent at all times the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party can always remain at an invincible position , can always win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to forge forward on a constant basis . "  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
has reiterated the principal position of the masses of the people , as well as our fundamental aim in bringing about a social , economic , and cultural development ; and has further straightened the relationship that the party should act as a " public servant " to the people .  This is a continued adherence and a new development to the party building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
So long as it always becomes a loyal representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces , the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
In the past two decades since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country 's overall national power has significantly strengthened , people 's living standard has been constantly improved and our international position had been greatly raised .  The most fundamental reason is due to the rapid and healthy economic and social development .  
So long as it is conducive to protecting the people 's fundamental interests , to economic construction and social stability , to punishing corruption and crimes , and to promoting close ties between the party and the masses , we should actively explore ways , be bold in taking actions and brave in finding new ways and achieve breakthroughs .  We should proceed from doing a good job in our own place , own department and own unit ;  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
" fundamental " means that once the scientific method is established , it will become the soul of the individual , the nation and the people .  It will stimulate the people to love life , to pursue truth , and to be intelligent and sharp , to be fair and unselfish , to be self-confident , not cocky , to be rigorous , not picky , to be upright and outspoken , calm and unhurried , to be filled with the spirit of creativity and creative vitality .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
With only three years of effort , a common automotive technician has become a " missile expert " The road that Xu Guangfeng has covered is but a detailed embodiment of the pioneering spirit with which officers and soldiers of our military have been trying hard to realize the " two fundamental changes " . 
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
Recently , Comrade Jiang Zemin stated that our party must always be the loyal representative that meets the requirements for development of advanced social productive forces of China , that is in line with the development trend of China 's advanced culture , and that is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
These provisions on the basis of reviewing our militarys experiences in information security and confidentiality in the new situation and learning positive practices from foreign countries and foreign military forces not only provide explicit requirements on some crucial issues , but also systematically specify the basic principle , duty and authorization , preventative measures and administrative procedures regarding information security and confidentiality .  These provisions are the fundamental basis for further strengthening the work of information security and confidentiality throughout the military as a whole .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Provided that our party remains the requirement of the development of advanced social productivity in China , the way forward for advanced culture in China and the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , it will always be invincible , will always have the heartfelt support of all ethnic groups throughout the country and will be able to lead the masses in pressing ahead incessantly .  
The thinking of " three represents , " with its profound meaning expressed in simple and concise language , is a new summary of the party 's nature , aim and fundamental tasks .  It is a new development of the Marxist theory of party building and a new requirement placed by the new situation on party organizations and party cadres at all levels .  It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
You Dexin emphasized that the motherland of Mainland China upholds several fundamental principles for the development of cross-strait economic relations : " direct and two-way , reciprocal and mutually beneficial , diverse , stable and long-term and adhering to agreements . "  Mainland China is completely in accord with the aims and spirit of the WTO .  
This is a major strategic disposition made by the party Central Committee and the State Council in light of the grim situation in public order currently facing China . It embodies a strong desire of the broad masses of the people and represents the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
Speaking of China 's foreign policies , President Jiang stressed : Maintaining independence and keeping the initiative are the most salient characteristics of China 's diplomacy .  On various international issues , China has all along formulated her policies or positions by constantly proceeding from the fundamental , long-term interests of the Chinese people and the people the world over , and in light of right and wrong in specific issues as well .  
Both sides indicate that it is an important choice made by China and Belarus in the face of changes in the international situation in the new century and is in the fundamental and long-term interests of both China and Belarus to deepen Sino-Belarussian comprehensive friendly relations and cooperation built on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , a high degree of trust , and combined efforts and to raise them to an entirely new level .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Comrade Wang Wei had broad revolutionary ideals and the spirit of lofty dedication ; he practiced our army 's fundamental purpose in model fashion , and faithfully carried out our army 's basic function ; he is an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary servicemen .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
Leading comrades from the State Council pointed out that basic education is the cornerstone of the strategy of vitalizing the country through science and education .  Its significance for improving the quality of the Chinese nation , nurturing qualified personnel of all types at all levels , and promoting socialist modernization is as broad as it is fundamental .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
Although water conservation work has been constantly strengthened , flood prevention capacities of major rivers in our country have been increased , and the flood prevention standards for these rivers have been raised in recent years , no fundamental change has been made in the weak foundation of flood prevention projects across the country , and risky sections of dikes and dams as well as risky reservoirs remain to be serious potential dangers in flood prevention .  
Administration according to law is an important style of modern administration , is an effective way of solving complex contradictions confronting us at present , and is also the fundamental requirement for building a clean and honest , diligent , pragmatic , and highly efficient government .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .

The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .

In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Japan have agreed with the fundamental interests of citizens of both countries .

To resolve problems that currently exist in such aspects of our work as prison , reeducation through labor , lawyer , notarization , and basic-level of legal services ; and to eliminate the contradictions of irrational structures , imperfect mechanisms , and unsatisfactory coordination between internal and external relations , a fundamental way out is to carry out the reform , and to seek and boost the development through the reform .  We must establish a correct outlook on the reform and development ;  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
In view of this , we , the vast numbers of Chinese living in overseas areas , strongly demand that based on China 's relevant laws as well as the international consensus on fighting against religious cults , and for the sake of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority the Chinese people and Chinese living in overseas areas , the Chinese Government should crack down harder on the handful of ' Falungong ' members who refuse to repent and mend their way .  
and banning prostitution , gambling , and narcotics .  We must unremittingly emphasize these basic work as measures to provide fundamental solutions in the " comprehensive management .

Since opening and reform were implemented , China 's rural operating system has undergone fundamental changes , but administrative system reform has lagged behind , meaning it could not meet the demands of rural market economic development .

In conducting such activities , we must have our eyes on improving the overall quality of the broad masses of rural grass-roots cadres , on solving existing conspicuous problems in rural areas , and on safeguarding and increasing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants .  Such study and education must be closely linked with promoting rural work .

In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .

It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
She said : " General legislative provisions can be , and indeed have to be , drafted in a precise and detailed way .  Even when frequent amendments to the provisions are required in order to accommodate the ever-changing social conditions , they will not create a profound impact on society .  However , the Basic Law is a piece of constitutional legislation which is fundamental to our society .  " Stability and foreseeability are paramount features of it , as they are of constitutions in other parts of the world .

Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
In the past 51 years , especially following the policy of economic reforms and opening up in the last two decades , our country has undergone fundamental changes .  The economy is developing rapidly ; social stability is maintained ; and the standard of living of the Chinese people is constantly improving .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
- The Bar Association has accepted the need for a legal regime to regulate the orderly exercise of a citizen 's right to take part in peaceful assemblies and processions .  At the same time , it states that it is a matter of fundamental importance that such legal regime should not be so overbearing as to have the effect of stifling or threatening any exercise of such a right .  
A comprehensive set of published laws , coupled with a stable and transparent legal system , are fundamental to investors ' confidence .  
On the basis that women 's rights are human rights , a strategic approach for advancement of women must bear in mind the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the right to development protected by the various instruments binding on the parties to the Beijing Declaration . 
The estimates derived from the model suggested that about half of the swings in property prices in Hong Kong since the early 1990s could be attributed to changes in fundamental variables , such as macro-economic activity , monetary conditions , demographic movement and public housing supply .  The other half was explained by the build-up of a bubble and its sudden collapse .  
And it will not condone any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin , which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life , " Ms Chan explained .  
Addressing some 100 guests at a reception hosted by the Swiss Chinese Chamber of Commerce , Mr Ma outlined Hong Kong 's fundamental strengths and efforts in maintaining its status as an international financial centre and the premier capital formation centre of the Mainland , the enhanced attractiveness to foreign investors following the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements , and the efforts and achievements in the financial services sector including the encouraging development of the Hong Kong bond market .  
The fundamental elements of western civilization , from columnar architecture , the aesthetic proportions of the human form and humanistic drama to geometric theorems , democracy and the theory of absolutism , all had their origin in the art and culture of ancient Greece .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Steadily Advancing Our Mainland Work " Building up Taiwan to recover the mainland " is a fundamental government policy . With the chief goals of our political call to the mainland being democracy , freedom , unification , and prosperity for all , we must advance our work in a steady , active , and positive manner while paying heed at all times to the political , economic , and social situation .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Reasons for Taiwanese forgetfulness of May Fourth are that modern Taiwan does not face the general national malaise which once afflicted China , Messrs . Democracy and Science have already been realized to some degree , cultural life is highly westernized , and the nativist movement of recent years has tended to increase estrangement from the mainland . " In Taiwan there is little interest in pursuing fundamental issues of China 's recent and modern development , " says Wu Chan-liang .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
These ideas affected the ways in which writers chose to present knights-errant in their novels . Says Lin , " At the most fundamental level , knights-errant are supposed to embody moral virtue . So while a writer might allow his hero to be less than perfect in some small ways , he will always stand fast when faced with an issue or choice of consequence . "  
" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings . So having been part of an organized movement , having worked within a group , I 've gone back to the beginning and am looking at myself . " Even as a child , Chen was introspective and given to challenging anything she perceived as unfair .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
Turning to cross-strait matters , President Chen , pointing to the recent enlargement of the European Union , declared that the trend toward regionalization has led to fundamental changes in conventional thinking about national sovereignty and territorial boundaries , and expressed hope that leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait would heed this trend and adopt a fresh new framework to find a way out of the tense cross-strait situation .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge . Their achievements show that if they work together , the trio of school , teacher , and parents can be a formidable one , and one which opens the door to truly excellent education .  
The draft resolution made a statement that " the current international economic order is still unjust , which hinders the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms " The statement was approved following heated discussions  
He noted that the lack of meaningful developments to date , while disappointing , had to be seen in the context of the difficult and fundamental changes taking place in the economic , social and political areas of the countries concerned .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The conclusions established that , in terms of its current substantive and procedural regulation , habeas corpus is extremely ineffective in protecting fundamental individual rights .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
More sustained and intensified international cooperation to provide logistical assistance to developing countries and practical measures against the laundering of drug money are fundamental to effective action to combat drug trafficking .  
The Charter required a steadfast commitment to democracy , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty and social justice , and equal security for all CSCE States .  
Women are entitled to the equal enjoyment and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .  
It is , therefore , fundamental that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation are well focused and that means for coordinating such activities are studied in order to avoid overlapping actions .  
The independent Commission of Experts concluded that even though the conflict in Rwanda was a domestic one its consequences affected the entire international community , inasmuch as fundamental principles of international humanitarian law were violated .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The Committee underlined that nondiscrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental , civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights must be effectively guaranteed in law and actively protected in practice if further ethnic unrest was to be avoided .  
Women are entitled to the equal enjoyment and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
We reaffirm the importance of fundamental freedoms , and the dignity of the human person and that all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
The concepts of collective security , fundamental human rights , international law and social progress for all are being corroded by ethnocentrism , isolationism , cultural animosity and economic and social debilitation .  
Research , understood as " careful search or inquiry , course of critical investigation " , " a systematic search for facts " , 3 / is and should continue to be a basic and generic activity at the same fundamental level as analysis and writing .  
The goal of such projects is to strengthen the capacity of such organizations to fulfil their legitimate and important role in generating a vigilant , continuous , informed and effective domestic demand for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Such determined arguments in the face of widespread and increasing suffering are clearly reprehensible and underlie a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of innocent persons .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
We resolve to protect our societies from organized crime in all its forms through strict and effective legislative measures and operational instruments , always consistent with internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
The refugee definition was meant to have an inclusive , rather than a restrictive meaning , in accordance with the fundamental objective of providing international protection to those lacking effective national protection , through the recognition of their refugee status .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute . 
At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
The United Nations is to be credited with impressive accomplishments in strengthening international peace and security , marshalling the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and apartheid , ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing countries and supporting their socio-economic development , advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and protecting and preserving the environment , as well as in promoting education , culture , science and health .  
However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
A thorough review of the final documents of recent international conferences clearly illustrates that , notwithstanding the conceptual and normative transformations which the international community has undergone in the formulation and expression of its concerns and recommendations , it has legitimately stood firm on the need to respect the fundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of our diverse and pluralistic world .  
Practising a healthy lifestyle , of which sporting activities are very much a part , is of fundamental importance in the development of the physical , intellectual and emotional potential of young people in order to make them responsible adults at ease in society .  
It is hard , however , to speak about either a successful and broad application of the educational potential of sport or sporting achievements in a country where the mass aspect of sport one of its fundamental principles has been violated as a result of aggression by the neighbouring Republic of Armenia .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
A fundamental contradiction in the practice of sanctions is that when they are introduced the main foundation is the interest of the international community , but when they are lifted the dominant factor is national interests - sometimes not even genuine ones - on the part of individual States .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the agenda item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " . 
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Demands the immediate and unconditional release of all persons who have not committed crimes against humanity and who are detained or imprisoned as a result of their struggle for self-determination and independence , full respect for their fundamental individual rights and compliance with article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 2 ] / under the terms of which no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
He stressed that it would be desirable to take a more flexible position regarding reservations , since incorporation of the provisions of the statute into national law was bound to raise fundamental issues of constitutional law .  
Recognizing that the growing threat of organized crime , with its highly destabilizing and corrupting influence on fundamental social , economic and political institutions , represents a challenge demanding increased and more effective international cooperation ,  
The need to initiate legislative amendments to reduce the almost indiscriminate possession and bearing of arms that now exists , and increased control by the security forces over the illegal possession and bearing of arms and over the entry of unregistered weapons into the country , are considered fundamental aspects of this commitment .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Recalling that in the Charter of the United Nations the peoples of the United Nations declared their determination to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples ,  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reiterating its profound conviction that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Affirms that a primary aim of international cooperation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom , dignity and peace for all peoples and for every human being , that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from promoting and protecting the others ;  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , stresses the need to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and to the return by refugees and displaced persons to their homes , and welcomes in this regard the commitments made by the Government of Rwanda ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .

It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .

The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .  
The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .

NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .  On the contrary , they had helped to advance the fundamental objective of broad participation by States .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
all national and international policies and measures , in particular those of an economic and financial character , should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective " .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .

" Distressed at the continued suffering of refugees for whom a solution has yet to be found , and noting with deep concern that refugee protection continues to be jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission , unlawful expulsion , refoulement , unjustified detention , other threats to their physical security , dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 22 September 1995 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled : " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee .

Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
It is no secret that the North Korean regime relies for its survival on a totalitarian system of control and an anachronistic personality cult , sustained by subjecting its people to a virtual state of slavery , by denying them the most fundamental human rights , by supporting international terrorism and by all the other accompaniments of a failed , rogue State .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
CARICOM was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas on 4 July l973 with the fundamental objectives of , first , promoting and facilitating economic development , thereby improving well-being and reducing poverty and unemployment ; secondly , strengthening and coordinating the interface of the small States of the Caribbean with the international community ; and , third , promoting , through cooperation , social and cultural development and the preservation of these .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
We would have preferred that the draft resolution set down as its principal operative conclusion a firm call on the international community to consider further the fundamental and challenging questions that the advisory opinion poses .  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
Secondly , it would require education for solidarity , in order to ensure , as a fundamental prerequisite for collective harmony , the permanent integration of our peoples on a solid basis of personal and national self-esteem , an education in which the principle of shared responsibility is increasingly strengthened in the minds and hearts of citizens .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .

During the last three millenniums the Greek people have remained wholeheartedly and deeply committed to the Olympic Ideal , founded on the noble principles of understanding , tolerance , solidarity and dignity .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .

We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .

Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,

Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms .

Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
The world has witnessed fundamental economic changes , such as the end of State control of economic life in many States , the withering away of numerous restraints on international trade , the easy transfer of capital and huge investments across the world .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only three years after the establishment of the United Nations reflected a common understanding that fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity provide the most solid foundation for peace , democracy , development and fruitful international cooperation in every field of human activity .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .

Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;

Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .

What is intended in article 42 , paragraph 2 , and article 43 , subparagraph ( d ) , is not defined clearly .  
Reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and , to that end , recognizing that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ,

Accordingly , as underlined in no uncertain terms by its Prime Minister , the demand that Eritrea must withdraw from all occupied Ethiopian territories for peace to be achieved between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been a firm Ethiopian position and a fundamental and irreducible minimum condition and not , as alleged by Eritrea , a new element injected by Ethiopia at the eleventh hour .

Indeed , it has now become common practice for the leadership in Addis Ababa to flagrantly violate fundamental principles of international law - whether it is in acts of brazen aggression , human rights violations or blatant incursions against neighbouring countries - and then accuse its victims for the very transgressions that it is guilty of in a pre-emptive , if transparent , manner . 
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .

There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 20 _ 21 and 29 _ 37 above ) . 
Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .

Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
The spirit of the instruments would seem to be clear : the right to education principally concerns personal development , but in cases where this personal development is itself linked to the quality of the relational fabric that the person is able to weave with his or her peers , this fundamental right necessarily takes on a universal dimension , since social or national communities can no longer exist and develop in isolation .  
In the area of space technology it is planned , in the near future , to develop fundamental and experimental research in the area of weightlessness physics and to develop basic technologies for producing unique materials and biological preparations with properties unobtainable on Earth .  
On that basis , the majority of Libyan legislative acts promulgated after the Great Revolution of 1 September are directed at all citizens , irrespective of gender ; they prescribe numerous rights to be enjoyed in all fields , without distinction between men and women , in so far as they are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , both male and female .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of citizens in decision-making and the development of competent public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures free and fair elections .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
Another fundamental international legal instrument elaborated by the CD is the CTBT , a treaty which was a long _ sought objective of the international community and which is supposed to block any further qualitative development of nuclear weapons .

It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognized community safety as a fundamental right , and that they integrated crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
We consider universal access to basic education and a substantial improvement in its quality to be the pillars of our commitment to social development and a fundamental basis for productive human development and democracy .  
We agree that there should be a broad approach to the issue of human rights which covers civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and which is based on respect for the dignity of persons and protection of their fundamental rights .  
Investment in education , including basic and digital literacy , remains the fundamental way of developing human capacity and should be at the heart of any national , regional and international information technology strategy .  
The fair and efficient management and administration of criminal justice , with due regard paid to human rights , were recognized as fundamental prerequisites for social and economic development .  
It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognize community safety as a fundamental right and that they integrate crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
How can we spread the implementation of human rights across the globe so that the practice of rights economic , social and cultural , and civil and political can foster cultures of respect and tolerance , in the framework of fundamental human rights ?  
The Declaration also recognized the fundamental right of all Kosovo residents to return to the province and that the cultivation of a strong and vibrant multiethnic civil society was essential for the future of Kosovo .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
Mr . Boldt ( Germany ) said that , to a large extent , fundamental social , economic and cultural challenges were triggered by demographic change , and the main demographic issue of the coming century would be ageing .  
Timely implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative is fundamental to enabling countries concerned to set aside sufficient resources for poverty reduction and investment in the social sectors .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
For the next election process to be perceived as free and fair , and for the full recognition of legitimacy in the authorities elected , the international community expects a stable environment , where fundamental rights can be guaranteed , where freedom of movement and expression is assured and where democracy can indeed be exercised .  Brazil is confident that the Government of Angola will make the best of the situation , in the benefit of the people and the future of the country .  
Yet it must be acknowledged that the proceedings have already been substantially transformed by the four major reforms I have just mentioned and can no longer be appreciably amended without interfering with the fundamental features of an international criminal trial as defined by the Council in the statute .  
Article 1 , paragraph 1 , of the Declaration of 1986 states : The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The article spells out three principles : first , there is a human right called the right to development which is inalienable ; second , there is a particular process of economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ; and third , the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development .  
Mauritanian legislation covers the fundamental rights and duties of persons , nationality , alien residency requirements , electoral regulations and territorial division into constituencies , regulations governing the ownership of property , the general organization of the civil service , economic and social activities of the State and so forth .  
The concern was expressed that paragraph 2 was formulated in an overly broad way and might inadvertently result in giving priority even to consensual rights and even in cases in which the forum might not wish to apply its own rules and to give priority to preferential rights existing under its own law since no fundamental policy issue might be involved in a particular case .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments assert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
According to Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction . . . .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
The rule of law implies that all institutions are subject to the law and also implies the separation of powers , the free exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the equality before law of citizens , male and female ; all of these aspects form the constitutive elements of a democratic system of government ;  
Categorizations of education into primary , elementary , fundamental , or basic are not internationally comparable and are unsuited to the requirements of international human rights law , which embodies the principle that children have to be in school until they reach the minimum age for employment .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
He explained that ESAF and PRGF were similar in the sense that they identified and supported sound and appropriate macroeconomic policies , but the fundamental difference was that the new PRGF emphasized consensus-building and participatory approaches driven by a country-owned process with an explicit focus on poverty reduction .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The most fundamental flaw reflected in the approach of the Independent Expert concerning the development compact is the idea that economic , social and cultural rights are entitlements that require correlated legal duties and obligations .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to , inter alia , financially and technologically support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to assist them , wherever possible , in the fulfilment of their obligations with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Express our firm conviction that the development of democratic systems of government in Africa , which guarantee full access and representation of all sectors of our societies , respect for and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , equitable distribution of wealth and access to economic advancement , active promotion of peace , preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution and an equitable international economic environment , is an essential prerequisite for the prevention of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all their forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .  
Reaffirming its commitment to the process of democratization of States , and recognizing that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
In the light of the achievement of near universal enrolment at the primary level , there has been no need for a concerted effort to establish a system of fundamental education for persons who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) strengthening the regulation capacities of the key State institutions ( including relations between the authorities ) ; ( b ) contributing to the decentralization and deconcentration of the central authorities ; ( c ) improving performance and access to justice ; and ( d ) increasing social , national , local and regional cohesion , and promoting the exercise of fundamental rights . 
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,  
The challenge of building functioning institutions safeguarding fundamental human rights and capable of supporting a multi-ethnic society based on democratic principles and tolerance is a major one .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
The construction services sector is a fundamental economic activity which permeates all sectors of the economy : it is an instrument for employment creation and a tool for upgrading welfare ; it has a major role to play in providing basic and safe infrastructure achieving social and economic development objectives in developing countries ; and local firms and professionals should be fully involved in this process .  
Upon the instructions of our respective Governments , we have the honour to request , pursuant to rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , the inclusion in the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of a supplementary item entitled Need to examine the exceptional international situation pertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan , to ensure that the fundamental right of its twenty-three-million people to participate in the work and activities of the United Nations is fully respected .  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
In summary , let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism ; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained ; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The establishment of an effective , functioning government administration was fundamental to the comprehensive mandate given to UNTAET under Security Council resolution 1272 ( 1999 ) , and is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .
