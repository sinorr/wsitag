In recent years , Shanxi has entered tourism into the list of the province 's superior industries , increased the work intensity of transforming the advantages in tourist resources into the industrial advantages , initially formed a few tourist zones with special characteristics , and taken firm control of the tourist infrastructure construction , environmental protection , ecological construction , historical relics protection , and the deep-level development of tourist serial products , with a view to repeatedly optimizing and upgrading tourism .  
He indicated that he hopes that both sides will actively open up new areas of cooperation and new approaches to cooperation to bring economic and trade cooperation between the two countries to a new level .  In particular , the development of western China , new and advanced science and technology , and environmental protection , etc . , may become key items in mutually beneficial cooperation in the future .  
In the meantime , the report points out that this year , the state has focused on 19 projects to be selected as the demonstration projects of high-tech industrialization in the western region , in a bid to support the local environmental protection , ecological construction , and transformation of advantageous resources for value appreciation , with the total investment amounting to nearly 2.4 billion yuan .  
In response to some important issues with common interests in both the Asian side and the European side , the Chinese Government proposed the holding an Asia-Europe environmental ministerial meeting , carrying out scientific and technological cooperation in Asian and European forest protection and sustainable development , and holding a seminar of Asian and European law enforcement institutions on cracking down on transnational crimes .  These proposals also won support from various Asian and European countries .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
The three proposals made by Zhu Rongji at the meeting regarding the further expansion of Asia-Europe cooperation in economic , trade , scientific and technological , and other spheres , the joint efforts to crack down on transnational crime and corruption , and the strengthening of cooperation in environmental protection and sustainable development were unanimously approved by the leaders of various countries and written into the document of the " Asia-Europe Cooperation Framework 2000 . "  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
Wen Jiabao said that in the past 20 years , China has persistently taken economic construction as the center , constantly increased its comprehensive national strength , and laid a solid material and technical foundation of environmental protection and ecological construction .  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
while trade unions , environmental protection and human rights organizations within the Democratic Party are quite active in recent years , opposing free trade and intensifying their liberal stand on many social issues .  
Proceeding from raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , Shanghai will , during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , treat the biotechnology , new materials , environmental protection , modern commodity flow as the four potential emerging industrial sectors and gradually nurture them to become new sectors to replace other sectors in the future .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
While avoiding project duplication and prohibiting the transfer of backward technology and without causing environmental pollution , we shall take strong measures in a number of areas including investment , budgeting , taxation , credit , trade , industry and commerce , labor , and statistics to support enterprises in east and central China in pursuing cooperation with the west by investing in and building factories in the west , buying shares in western enterprises , acquiring or merging with western enterprises , and transferring technology to western enterprises .  
and commercial housing .  In 1999 and 2000 , the state separately issued another 110 billion yuan 's and 150 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction bonds , and while making arrangements to continue the state bond-funded projects already under construction , some new projects were added .  They included some technological transformation projects in key trades and industries , the installation of Chinese-made equipment in major projects and the industrialization of advanced technologies , some environmental and ecological construction projects , and some educational infrastructure projects .  
According to authoritative persons , numerous experiments on space-to-earth monitoring , space science , and space science applied survey research were planned for the current unmanned spacecraft flight test , including two space life science and biotechnological research experiments , two space material scientific experiments , and one space astronomical and space environmental forecast and survey research experiment .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
The western areas should proceed from their actual conditions , make full use of the preference policies of the state in shifting more financial input to the western areas , more effectively implement the strategy of " relying on science and education for national regeneration , " first make substantial developments in the fields of science and technology , education , infrastructure construction , and ecological environmental construction , and thus lay a solid foundation for comprehensive economic development and social progress in the future .  
Speaking on the legislation for environmental protection , Qu Geping said : The NPC Standing Committee of the last two terms has drawn up the Flood Control Law , the law for controlling solid wastes from polluting the environment , and other laws .  With the substantive amendments made to the law for controlling atmospheric pollution , the law for protecting the maritime environment , and the law for land management , they have created a preliminary framework of laws for protecting the environment and natural resources .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .  
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
China National Space Agency the other day officially announced in Beijing the activation of its " two-satellite earth and space survey program , " saying : The program 's implementation is of great importance and significance to enhancing China 's innovation capability with regard to space physical research or space environmental forecast and raising China 's capability of ensuring safety of space activities or guarding against earth and space environmental disasters or fluctuations , and is conducive to heightening China 's earth and space survey standard or developing China 's space physics by a large margin as well . 
- investigate diseases and unusual deaths reported in wholesale and retail markets ; - improve environmental hygiene at wholesale markets ; - work on the issue of a prohibition order to prevent the importation of live chickens other than those that are derived from farms certified free from the disease by the Veterinary Officer of the exporting country .  
Announcing details of the Study on Sustainable Development for the 21st Century ( SUSDEV21 ) at a press conference today ( Monday ) , the Director of Planning , Dr Peter Pun , said : " If Hong Kong is to continue to thrive in the next century , we need to maintain our environmental quality at an acceptable level and safeguard the integrity of our natural resource base and cultural heritage while at the same time continuing to meet development pressure arising from growing social and economic needs . 
In certain busy areas , cleansing services last until mid-night .  Since the number of local residents in the New Territories has risen from 2.07 million ( 37 per cent of Hong Kong population ) to 3.11 million ( 47 per cent of Hong Kong population ) over the previous decade , the RSD opined that the standard of environmental hygiene should be improved .  
The new facility is designed and is being built to meet stringent environmental standards .  An underground waste water treatment plant is under construction for treatment of effluent generated from livestock holding and slaughter .  
In the course of treatment , some clinical staff may commit errors due to factors related to experience , professional judgement and personal or other environmental reasons .  As a result , the patients concerned may not be able to receive proper treatment .  The occurrence of these isolated mistakes can not be construed to indicate that all our frontline clinical staff lack alertness or the sense of accountability , and neither does this have any direct relation with the strength of frontline manpower resources .  
In considering the selection of the decontamination methods , the consultants have taken into account the type , extent and spread of the contamination , prevailing work safety requirements , international standards on the level of soil contamination ; and the geographical setting of the contaminated areas and any possible secondary environmental impact on the neighbourhood .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The conversion of a former illegal hawking and environmental hygiene black spot into a tidy sitting out area provides further proof that co-operation between government departments and private property management can tackle even the most intractable urban blight , a senior Home Affairs Department ( HAD ) official said today ( Saturday ) .  
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
Speaking at a press conference , the acting Director of Home Affairs , Mr Lui Hau-tuen said : " The Private Buildings Cleansing Campaign is aimed at enhancing public awareness of the importance of a healthy living environment ; improving the environmental hygiene standard of buildings ; and promoting clean buildings and clean neighbourhood .  
" Forty-seven newly completed projects will also be commissioned for use as scheduled .  A series of eye-catching exhibitions and extensive cultural , sports and recreational activities will be launched .  The Department will also enhance its environmental hygiene work to prepare for the arrival of the new millennium , and will provide a pleasant urban environment for people to enjoy , " Miss Chung said .  
The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
The brief issued to prospective consultants requires the successful consultant to identify any shortcomings in the existing requirements , conduct a comparative study of international and other relevant national requirements , identify special local factors that should be taken into account in formulating the new requirements , consider the integration of the new requirements with building form so as to enhance and encourage energy efficiency and to reduce external environmental impact , and propose new standards and the appropriate means of control .  
It is reported that the Government intends to collaborate with members of the commercial and industrial sectors to set up various action groups to identify solutions to the environmental pollution problems in Hong Kong ; and that some overseas persons have refused to take up work in Hong Kong for fear that our polluted environment will be hazardous to their health .  
I have recently received complaints from the public that some recycling bins provided by the Council are not cleared .  Hence , people who support environmental protection discover that these bins are too full for further loading when they carry the domestic waste papers and other recyclable items to the bins .  This would not only disappoint those people who support environmental protection , but would also lead to the waste papers and other recyclable items being accumulated next to the bins , resulting in stacks of refuse .  
The handbook contains information on HAD 's services , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumer rights , social order , corruption prevention , emergency services , environmental protection , The Ombudsman , Pedestrian Code , protection of intellectual property and a list of non-governmental organisations providing services for new arrivals .  
The Chief Executive stressed that the Government was determined to put in place sound policies and an effective organisation staffed by competent personnel , and to work with the green groups as partners to bring about improvements in environmental quality .  
" The contesting schools will now have to nominate a choir with no more than 60 members to compete in the final contest to be held next month , " he said .  The song contest , organised in association with the Education Department for the first year , is a health education programme aimed at raising students ' awareness of the importance of public health as well as arousing their interest in promoting personal , environmental and food hygiene through composing health-related lyrics and singing in groups .  
About 500 square metres of public open space , together with adequate private landscaped open space , at the podium level may be provided to enhance environmental quality .  
But it is also in the voters ' own interest to exercise their franchise as those elected would have a major say in determining their quality of life , such as in the areas of environmental hygiene , housing , medical services , and in the provision of public amenities , as well as recreational and sports facilities and services . "  
Based on the approved EIA report undertaken by the consultants , given that the number of vehicle trips per day is low and the material transfer station is not close to the nearby residents , no adverse environmental impacts to the nearby residents are anticipated from the operation of the works area .  
Eight sites , covering about 24.77 hectares , are zoned " Comprehensive Development Area " for medium or high density commercial / residential developments to fully utilize the development potential of those sites near the rail stations / light rail transit ( LRT ) terminus or to encourage environmental improvement in areas with existing industrial / residential interface problems .  
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
" Our recurrent expenditure on environmental protection and conservation will grow by 7.6% in real terms , reflecting additional resources for commissioning and operating new sewage treatment plants , increased payments for the disposal of waste due to the commissioning of new facilities , additional staff for implementing air quality initiatives and additional resources for new barging points and for sorting facilities for construction and demolition waste . " she added .  
Whilst the EPD shares Greenpeace 's concern on issues such as the need to control persistent organic pollutants , promote clean industry , enhance waste recovery and recycling , the EPD is very concerned that Greenpeace 's action has often done the opposite in misleading the public in understanding some key environmental issues .  
If we can become a pioneer in developing a set of innovative environmental protection technologies which are suitable for the region , we can help create a green and sustainable environment not only for our own future generations , but for our neighbours as well .  
This is examining the environmental , engineering , financial and operational aspects of alternative plans for the sewage system serving the main urban areas in order to make recommendations on the most sustainable way forward .

The spokesman emphasized that Government 's objective is to ensure continued reliable electricity supply at lowest reasonable cost to consumers and to balance our economic and environmental needs .  
As a further step , from next year , all major government policies and strategic proposals will be subject to sustainability impact assessments .  This will ensure that decision-makers address a wide range of consequences - economic , social and environmental - before proposals are finalised and implemented .  This will help ensure an improved quality of life for our children and future generations .  
He said , " The scope of work of the Home Affairs Bureau has a direct bearing on our daily lives .  At present , our Government has spared no efforts in promoting environmental protection , improving our living environment and implementing greening programmes to make Hong Kong a more comfortable and pleasant place .  
There were many complicated technical and architectural problems to tackle in this project , such as geotechnical structures , electrical services installations , preservation of the historical remains and natural environments as well as special environmental conditions required for the preservation and display of artefacts that have to be taken into consideration .  
In view of public concern over air quality for pedestrians , the department had been actively involved in the use of alternative environmental friendly vehicles and fuel and introduced pedestrianisation schemes in some areas to provide pedestrians with a safer , healthier and more comfortable street environment , he said .  
" They have brought their enormous creativity into full play , centering around optimization of living space and building efficiency , integration of technological and environmental concepts , and harmonization with physical environment , " Dr Cheng said , adding that the innovative ideas had rightly set a new direction for public housing development and were extremely valuable for future reference .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 19 areas , including population ; labour ; industry and commerce ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; and the environment .

" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
For applications that have previous approvals from the Board but have been revoked because of non-compliance of planning conditions , planning permission will only be granted if the applicants have included in the submissions technical assessments or proposals to demonstrate that the proposed uses will not generate adverse drainage , environmental and traffic impacts on the surrounding areas , and the assessments are acceptable to concerned departments .  
Mrs Ng stressed that the conceptual development option had been measured against a comprehensive set of criteria , ranging from land-use planning , urban design , landscape , heritage , social and economic issues to cost , transport and environmental considerations .  
The Authority has also set key environmental management goals and targets for the coming years .  These include improving energy saving in new estates and the recovery rate of waste for recycling , increasing water recycling at construction sites , enhancing environmental design of residential buildings and adopting environmentally friendly building materials .  
During its stay in Ottawa and Toronto , the delegation will meet with parliament members and committees dealing with trade and commerce , environmental protection , health care , technology and international relations , as well as senior officials of the Canadian Government , representatives of major overseas Chinese social and business communities , and other non-Government organizations .  They will exchange views with each other on the latest political and economic developments in their regions .  
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; environment ; and topical studies .  
According to the findings of the EIA study , the potential impacts arising from the project on various aspects ( including impacts on water quality , air quality , noise , waste management , ecology , fisheries and cultural heritage as well as landscape and visual impacts ) can meet the established environmental objectives .  
Energy Ministers in previous meetings agreed that the application of economically sound measures to minimise the adverse environmental impacts of energy production and use was essential for protecting the well-being of both present and future generations .  
The full set of 1999 Hong Kong Definitive Stamps is beautifully arranged in an elegant wooden black frame and mounted on environmental friendly acid free paper to ensure its long-lasting appreciation value .  
As for other types of battery waste which are disposed of at the three landfills , they should not cause environmental problems since the landfills are lined with impermeable liners to prevent underground leakage of contaminated liquid , and such liquid is properly collected and treated within the landfills .  
This enables MTRCL to commence work on the Project before the grant of the franchise , including developing a sufficient design for the System and its ancillary developments , carrying out requisite environmental and technical studies , and completing the necessary statutory procedures .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
" With the promotion of various precautionary measures against AP by the Department of Health over the past few weeks , we believe that members of the public are all on high alert to guard against the disease .  We are now aware that washing hands frequently , building up good body immunity , wearing facemasks and paying heed to environmental hygiene are effective means to prevent AP . "  
During the weekend we will clean up a great variety of venues , ranging from public housing , private housing , environmental hygiene black spots , to social , educational institutions and commercial premises , as well as engaging all sectors of the community .  The places that will be cleaned up include : ( a ) Multi-storey buildings  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; the environment ; and topical studies .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon YEUNG Yiu-chung , says : " That this Council urges the Government to expeditiously draw up a set of cross-sector and sustainable framework and strategies to reorganize and enhance the environmental hygiene improvement measures of the relevant government bureaux and departments , and to pool the efforts of various sectors of the community , including the business and education sectors , professional bodies , District Councils and non-government organizations , to mobilize the participation of all citizens to ensure that Hong Kong becomes a clean and hygienic metropolis . "  
Last week , the " Team Clean " headed by the Chief Secretary for Administration announced a wide range of firm and decisive measures to promote good personal and public hygiene , tackle the environmental hygiene black spots , and give Hong Kong a complete face-lift .  
( iii ) The " Team Clean " headed by the Chief Secretary for Administration announced last week , as Phase I of the team 's work , a wide range of firm and decisive measures to promote good personal and public hygiene and tackle the environmental hygiene black spots .  These measures will produce quick and visible improvements in our living environment .  
Six illegal cooked food hawking black spots in PHEs were identified under the Government 's Team Clean initiatives in improving territory-wide environmental hygiene .  A total of about 200 joint operations were carried out in these estates including Tai Wo Hau , Lei Muk Shue , Shek Lei ( I ) , Lower Wong Tai Sin ( II ) , Wah Fu and Lok Wah ( North ) .  
It has been agreed that existing expert groups and new groups established under the Sixth Plenary will be consolidated into 15 groups .  They will undertake studies , follow up and implement various co-operation items endorsed at the Joint Conference . They will also continue to take forward other co-operation items , including Tonggu Waterway , co-operation in sustainable development and environmental protection , information exchanges , and co-operation in culture and sports .  
Both sides will actively take forward the major cross-boundary infrastructural projects .  Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macao have decided to set up a Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Advance Work Coordination Group ( Coordination Group ) .  Hong Kong will be the convenor of the Coordination Group , and Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macau will each appoint three representatives as members of the Coordination Group to coordinate and take forward the advance work for the construction of the Bridge , including studies on economic benefits , alignment , environmental protection and hydrology .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
He told the Executive Yuan that large-scale investment and planning should be effected to make the region a protected area . In 1981 , the Home Administration invited experts in park and environmental planning to assist in organization of the national park scheme . The team spent one year investigating the plant and animal life in the area , as well as the geology , climate and natural ecology of the entire peninsula .  
People must be educated to appreciate the importance of environmental protection , Shih Meng-hsuing stressed , if the ideals of the national park concept are to be realized . People in Taiwan , he explained , lack concern for preservation of natural resources ; both tourists and local residents indiscriminately pocket shells and coral and carry off rare plant and animal life . The thoughtless littering of park and beach areas is also a serious problem which could lead to serious damage , especially to those more sensitive areas like the fragile coral reefs .  
Since we are still a middle-income nation , we must continue to develop our economy , yet at the same time , the affect of our dense population and the concentrated development of industry makes environmental questions extremely worthy of attention . Thus , our present policy is for economic growth and environmental protection to be simultaneously planned and considered and to be developed in balance .  
The premier stated that the Taiwan region has a prosperous society and a well-to-do way of life , but that owing to rapid economic growth , the increase of the population , and the swift spread of urbanization , the environmental protection measures and the related public infrastructure of the area have been hard put to remain adequate to the needs of the times .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
We must increase our investment in education in response to the long-term needs of our national development , and to realize the ideal of lifetime education . We must harmonize labor-management relations to ensure the smooth development of production . We must strengthen environmental protection . We must establish a social security system to assist the aged , debilitated , handicapped , and ill .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
If we look at it from a planning point of view , today 's social disorder shows the shortcomings of the government 's planned investments in social affairs . In the past economic growth was stressed , environmental protection deemphasized ; the environmental protection movement is the inevitable price to be paid . Everyone must acknowledge this , only then can the truth be understood .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services . This has caused the island 's medical standards to be , like its geographic location , quite distant from Taiwan .  
Japan 's environmental movement has been joined by doctors , lawyers and experts in various fields who have helped to set up research and legal channels to follow and even to educate the local populace in environmental issues enabling disputes to be resolved within the system and at the same time raising environmental awareness . "  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
In particular , though there are now many large corporations , many of these were built up from scratch by hard-working and frugal entrepreneurs . It would just be too painful for them to lay out the large amount of cash required to bring in an environmental engineering firm to install a full set of equipment .  
Today geologists are also worried that additional extraneous factors of environmental change , such as the possible melting of glacial ice due to the greenhouse effect , leading to a worldwide rise in sea levels , may further exacerbate the problem , causing land to sink into the sea even faster .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
Later , several women from Awakening branched off to form their own practical support groups , such as the Taipei Women 's Rescue Foundation , which mainly offers assistance to underage prostitutes , and the Homemakers ' Union and Foundation , which emphasizes environmental education . In addition , several " friendly peripheral associations " dealing with child prostitution , the rights of women workers , and so on , were also formed , thus gradually creating an intricate network .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
The reason there is still such a dazzling array of species on Earth today , with all the " natural wonders " they display , is because since life took its first steps , animals have shown a resilient capacity to face the challenges of all kinds of environmental pressures , by every imaginable means . Although the process has been a bloody one in which many species have bowed out into history , new species have continuously stepped forward onto the stage .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Liu Ming-lung , secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Education Foundation , notes that wet paddy field has a number of useful environmental functions , including stabilizing flow volume in rivers , absorbing excess in times of heavy rains and floods , improving water quality , reducing soil erosion , and improving air quality .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
As environmental standards have risen , the Basel Convention has been repeatedly amended . It lists over 50 types of hazardous waste for which cross-border movements are controlled , and by coordination with the World Customs Organization , new tariff schedule codes have been defined to more effectively control international movements of hazardous waste .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
In this issue are stories on the latest trends and options for graduate study , the changing structure of Taiwan 's population , the impact of environmental hormones , the community regeneration movement in aboriginal villages in eastern Taiwan , the legendary master of glove puppetry Huang Hai-tai , the beginning of efforts to stage Nobel Prize laureate Gao Xingjian 's Snow in August , and celebrities such as Angie Chai and Chien Wen-hsiu . Kick back , relax and read , and get a better understanding of our society , our home .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc . In no time at all the referendum seems to have become the convenient new favorite for solving deadlocked disputes .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Compound Eyes examines the question of environmental ethics , and tells a riveting ecological tale that juxtaposes the huge and the miniscule , the distant and the near , the perfect and the flawed .  
Immunity seesaw Although allergies are caused by physiological factors , adverse environmental factors can make an allergy much worse . Chiang Bor-luen points out that nitric oxide , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , and other waste gases emitted by motor vehicles and factories can harm the respiratory tract and aggravate a preexisting allergy .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .  
Over a decade ago , Hsu Jen-hsiu founded an environmentalist group and funneled his passion for exploration into disseminating environmental concepts . Lin A-min said farewell to the mountains in order to work . He says that life in Taipei seems even more like an exploration , packed with all kinds of curious spectacles and personalities . And last year Max Liu , whom nearly all of Taiwan 's explorers hold in the highest regard , departed this life and continued his exploration of the unknown in the mysterious world beyond .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
Typhoon Herb 's furious assault on central Taiwan in 1996 provoked waves of criticism of the overexploitation of hillside land areas . In view of social trends and the impact of Taiwan 's future accession to the WTO , it was decided that the NTU farm would switch to eco-experience tours and environmental education : thus was born the " Meifeng Eco-Experience Camp . "  
of course , sino japanese relations are not confined to economic cooperation and trade the two sides share identical views on major international issues with the deepening of mutual understanding , the two countries will surely make further progress in their cooperation in the areas of politics , culture and environmental protection  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
It attributed this alarming decline to a rapid population growth , uneven and poor rainfall patterns , environmental degradation , civil conflicts , an unfavorable international economic environment and inappropriate domestic policies  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
the standing committee also amended and improved the following : " civil procedural law ( for trial use ) , " " land use law , " " law on chinese foreign equity joint venture , " " law on environmental protection , " " patent law , " and " trade mark law "  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
The root causes of population movements and refugee flows continued to be both natural and man-made , with combinations of political , military , economic , climatic and environmental factors varying from situation to situation .  
It is widely recognized today that the concept of development has acquired a multidimensional character encompassing not only economic growth , but also political , social and environmental aspects .  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Activities of particular concern included the improper disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes , wilful pollution of the environment , negligent or reckless serious environmental damage , and trafficking in endangered species .  
These core offences , which could be autonomous and independent of environmental regulatory laws , should include deliberate , reckless or negligent assaults on the environment that cause or create imminent risks of serious damage , harm or injury .  
Today , spurred by concern over the potential for global warming and acid precipitation , coal is often criticized as a major source of environmental degradation at the local , regional and global levels .  
Political , regulatory , investment , fiscal , environmental and monetary issues have emerged as significant in encouraging direct foreign investment in mineral exploration .  
Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
The Bank 's policy in regard to lending outside the European Union has been based on detailed economic and technical analysis of alternative solutions and the optimum size and timing of project implementation , together with their environmental impact .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
In the past , environmental costs were measured largely in terms of the expense involved in remedial treatment of degraded water quality , investment in environmental control technologies , or compensation for damage caused to local farm land by toxic dust .  
The norm in environmental regulation is that Governments set maximum permissible discharge levels or minimum levels of acceptable environmental quality .  
Among the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual life styles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .  
With reductions in international and regional tensions , and with the growing recognition of global economic and environmental interdependence , the opportunity to mobilize human and financial resources for global problemsolving has never been greater .  
The complementarity of those national population reports to others commissioned by recent international conferences and initiatives relating to economic , environmental , social and related activities is noteworthy and encouraging .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .  
Activities in the area of sustainable environmental futures focus on the complex interactions of physical and human activities in changing the environment , especially in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world , and the effects upon sustainability .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
National access to information on international economic , demographic , social and environmental conditions is essential not only to informed decisionmaking , but also to competitive and effective participation in international markets .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
A provisional network of national focal points has also been established , representing all global regions and serving as a base on which to build the international response capacity to environmental emergencies .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
The Commission also regards the achievement of a safe and healthy environment , through strong and effective international and domestic environmental protection efforts , as an essential component of sustainable development .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
While national Governments were primarily responsible for implementing Agenda 21 and other environmental instruments the developing countries lacked the financial resources and technology to do so without continued and enhanced international cooperation .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
The Agency 's health-care programme continued to provide comprehensive primary care , including preventive and curative medical care , maternal and child health services , family-planning services and projects to improve environmental health , in addition to secondary care in the form of hospitalization and other referral and support services .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
In its proposed work programme for 1996-1997 , UNEP planned to support the work of the Centre in improving the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people .  Finally , the Executive Director assured the Commission that she would carry out all the extra tasks that would arise out of Habitat II .  
The deliberate creation of regional trading blocs , the introduction of managed trade and the attempts to link human rights , environmental considerations and labour codes to trade are major threats which , if implemented , would dim the hope of a free environment for trade .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
Unfortunately , Ukraine does not have the potential to cover on its own the substantial expenses required to solve the set of social , economic and environmental problems connected with eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
At the same time , the legal regime develops apace , as experts learn simultaneously to apply multiple sets of norms from such diverse areas as commercial law , civil law , environmental law , international economic law , the law of the sea , public and private international law and mining law .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts . 
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  3 .  Strengthening participation of youth in the protection ,  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Strengthen the capacities of their local governing bodies to deal more effectively with the broad range of developmental and environmental challenges associated with rapid and sound urban growth through comprehensive approaches to planning that recognize the individual needs of cities and are based on ecologically sound urban design practices ;  
Improving the use of data and information at all stages of planning and management , making systematic and simultaneous use of social , economic , developmental , ecological and environmental data ; analysis should stress interactions and synergisms ; a broad range of analytical methods should be encouraged so as to provide various points of view ;  
Strengthen information , systematic observation and assessment systems for environmental , economic and social data related to land resources at the global , regional , national and local levels and for land capability and land-use and management patterns ;  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
Countries are encouraged to set up national advisory environmental education coordinating bodies or round tables representative of various environmental , developmental , educational , gender and other interests , including non-governmental organizations , to encourage partnerships , help mobilize resources , and provide a source of information and focal point for international ties .  
Countries , assisted by international organizations , non-governmental organizations and other sectors , could strengthen or establish national or regional centres of excellence in interdisciplinary research and education in environmental and developmental sciences , law and the management of specific environmental problems .  
At national and provincial levels , water supply and environmental sanitation policies will be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization , while at the county level , programmes will be implemented to increase access to adequate quantities of water , improved latrine construction and hygiene education .  
In the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual lifestyles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
During a period of 60 years , the district 's population increased fivefold , and average output per unit of land rose almost tenfold , while environmental conditions measurably improved largely through the autonomous undertaking of erosion control measures by the farmers themselves .  
Within the changing context of sustainable development , developmental efforts should be able to pay its full costs , that is , the environmental and social costs ; for this reason resources have to be priced at or equal to the marginal value or scarcity rent and incorporated into development-related decision-making .  
The environmental problems have been aggravated by agricultural policies - which have encouraged increasing production of some commodities on fragile lands and the use of inappropriate farm practices - and the lack of markets to value environmental public goods or the failures of some markets to internalize environmental costs and benefits within farmers ' decision-making .  
Initiatives include increased research in the understanding of processes involved in climate , its variability , drought occurrence and desertification ; a new interactive database for use by local people and decision makers ; a new experimental network data project on river flow regimes in parts of Africa ; and the development of national environmental information systems .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
It decided to transmit to the Economic and Social Council a draft resolution on the contribution of comprehensive national policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems ( draft decision III ) .  
Today these plantations and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of silvicultural interventions , overmaturation and inadequate control of excessive wildlife populations ( which , in addition to being a generally uneconomical activity , is not appreciated by the general public ) , and new environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate changes .  
The international debate is increasingly concerned with how to reconcile national development objectives with such global environmental objectives as ameliorating climate change or conserving genetic pools to a degree that is often well beyond the needs of individual nation States .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
Future decision-makers must be trained to take an interdisciplinary approach that spans the environmental , social , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological advance .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
This is based on the need to train future decision-makers to take an interdisciplinary approach to the promotion of technology by evaluating the environmental , sociological , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological innovation and implementation .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
One representative , while questioning the ability of the draft articles to provide adequate environmental protection for international watercourses , wondered in particular whether the emphasis on optimal utilization did not overshadow the objective of leaving a watercourse in a pristine state .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
Several participants called for an increased role for UNEP 's regional offices on trade-environment issues , for greater emphasis on raising environmental understanding , awareness-building and education , and for technical analysis in such areas as prior informed consent , environmental reviews of trade policy , environmental dispute avoidance , analysis of intellectual property rights in technology transfer and international cooperation .  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
Recommendation 1 , Catalytic role of UNEP in emerging environmental issues : UNDP should , in its catalytic role in emerging environmental issues , draw to a greater extent on the contributions of the United Nations system and of the international scientific and other professional communities , to ensure that problems of wide international significance receive appropriate and adequate consideration by Governments , through the Governing Council and other bodies .  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
By its decision 16 / 25 of 31 May 1991 , the Governing Council set the following long-term goals for the work of ELI / PAC : ( a ) a coherent body of international law in the environmental field ; ( b ) national environmental laws adopted and institutions established in developing countries ; and ( c ) an operational comprehensive database on national and international environmental law . 
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
The granting of assistance is limited to the following conditions : ( a ) it should be selective and restricted to those parts of the economy where severe difficulties would otherwise occur ; ( b ) it should be limited to well-defined transitional periods laid down in advance and adapted to the specific socio-economic problems associated with the implementation of a country 's environmental programme ; and ( c ) it should not create significant distortions in international trade and investment .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
In this regard , the Commission may address the insufficient political acceptability of economic instruments ; difficulties in the design of economic instruments ; administrative difficulties with economic instruments ; conflicts between environmental and other policy objectives ; anxiety about repercussions on the international competitiveness of the national economy ; and adverse economic and structural conditions that the application of economic instruments may encounter .  
Aware of the need to recognize the importance of an understanding of gender issues within all areas of agricultural , social , economic , environmental and political life in order to achieve a balanced division of roles and responsibilities and an equitable access to resources and to the benefits of development ,  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations . 
To encourage Governments , relevant international organizations and the private sector to undertake further work with regard to the application of economic instruments , including tax reforms and the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in accordance with the conditions , needs and priorities of each country and giving full consideration to their potential environmental , economic and social impacts .  
To provide leadership in undertaking joint studies to develop further proposals to promote cooperation ( keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities ) in the implementation of nationally determined policy reforms through some form of voluntary consultative process that is flexible , and would proceed in stages and address the sectors and policies that offer the most promising opportunities for environmental , social and economic gains ;  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Governments have a responsibility to provide the necessary enabling environment , guiding markets and investments so that they operate in a manner compatible with national economic , social and environmental objectives and international trade arrangements and facilitate sustainable development .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
In decision 1993 / 239 , the Economic and Social Council took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , 1 / and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
The Economic and Social Council , in decision 1993 / 239 , took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Since 1959 , the scope and importance of space applications have expanded from a narrow field of science and technology to a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications , weather forecasting , resource management , prevention and mitigation of disaster , environmental monitoring and other social and economic activities in virtually every country .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
The subprogramme , in collaboration with United Nations organizations and international and national research institutions , aims at promoting the further development and application integrated environmental and economic analysis instruments , as well as national , regional and international programmes and policies for sound environmental management and sustainable development .  
ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
It was noted that industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required the adoption of measures to create an environment conducive to private investment ; ( i ) The importance of reversing environmental degradation and addressing its negative implications for long-term development was stressed .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
Research on " Caspian , Aral and Dead Sea Water Crisis and Perspectives " has been aimed at providing a comprehensive and objective environmental management setting for sustainable development , taking into account international political considerations and conflict resolution .  State-of-the-art research papers for the Forum have been commissioned , and a long-term field research programme is being designed as a part of the present project .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :  
Sixteen recurrent publications .  ( i ) Air pollution ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) national environmental performance reviews ( 6 ) ; ( iii ) environmental series ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) water series ( 2 ) ; and ( v ) revisions to the industrial accidents manual ( 4 ) ;  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
A provision of $ 58,100 would be required to hire consultants ( $ 24,700 ) to provide specialized inputs for documents related to regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of environmental policies and changing production patterns in the housing and urban infrastructure construction sector , including proposals for its modernization , and ( $ 33,400 ) for the convening of three ad hoc expert group meetings .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
In support of efforts to advance and incorporate environmental concerns at the earliest possible stages of economic decision-making , as recommended by Agenda 21 , support has been provided to a network of southern NGOs and development practitioners to build their capacity and collaboration capability in communications and research activities aimed at clarifying key policy issues before the Commission on Sustainable Development ( CSD ) .  
Special attention is drawn to the need for improved delivery of information to decision makers and to increased participation in environmental observations at the local and national levels within regional and international frameworks .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
It is easy to understand , in view of the difficulties of the alternative assessment methods discussed above , the aforementioned trend in international practice to limit reparation of environmental damage to the payment of costs of restoration , the replacement or damaged or destroyed resources or the introduction of equivalent resources where the court deems this to be reasonable .  
The Commission notes with concern that the growing recognition of the need to address patterns of production and consumption has not yet been matched by a full understanding of the implications of such patterns on economic , social and environmental conditions at the local , national and global levels .  
The Commission emphasizes that strengthened international cooperation in harmonizing criteria for the setting of voluntary product standards , with due regard to the specific environmental , social and economic conditions in developing producer / exporting countries , should take into account concerns about market access and the competitiveness of products and services .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
Delegations supported the broad goals of these recommendations , which were for UNEP to ( i ) reinforce its catalytic role , ( ii ) enhance its environmental coordinating activities within the United Nations system ; and ( iii ) facilitate its capacity to address emerging environmental issues .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
Specific reimbursement rates for environmental and intensified operational use conditions would be recommended by the initial United Nations technical survey team for approval within the mission budget and revised as required by changing circumstances .  
Consequently , re-emphasis on social infrastructure , and on " social capital " 1 / is now seen as indispensable for avoiding the pervasive cycle of economic decline , increasing poverty and environmental degradation from which many countries are now struggling to escape .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Review existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
This cooperation may contribute to the international establishment of an accessible joint implementation regime that is sensitive to environmental , developmental , social and economic priorities .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
The International Council of Environmental Law stated that , in partnership with the Environmental Law Centre of IUCN , it maintained what was probably the world 's most extensive collection of documents on environmental law and policy ( international treaties , supranational instruments , national legislation , soft law , literature and documents of international organizations , especially the United Nations system ) .  
The establishment of open relations and transparent cooperation among the States in the region in all areas , such as economy , trade , transport , telecommunications , environmental protection and other areas of common interest for independent and versatile development of the States and of the region as a whole based on the openness of the region to all neighbouring regions in order to ensure unimpeded flow of people , goods and capital ;  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
This composite picture of economic hardship compounded by environmental devastation , and of social strife compounded by economic hardship , has drawn only limited sympathy from the international community .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
NULLReview existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
NULLThe educational and training series entitled Explorations in Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) Technology consists of a set of workbooks designed for self-exploration of analytical techniques and major application areas in information systems technology for environmental managers .  Over 3,500 copies have been distributed since 1991 .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
NULLThe participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
NULLUNFPA is committed under its 1982 memorandum on cooperation and liaison with OIC to promote awareness of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , and to extend systematic and sustainable assistance to OIC member States , at their request , in dealing with their population problems .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
62 The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive , synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .  
Bearing in mind that many national legal systems recognized the concept of environmental damage and that various international conventions protected the environment , his delegation considered it sensible to have included in the draft articles a clear and comprehensive definition of " harm " .  
integral part of international cooperation on concrete issues in the economic , environmental and social fields to support plans and priorities of developing countries in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
The representative of the United States of America said that at the Conferences held at Rio de Janeiro , Vienna , Cairo , Copenhagen and Beijing , Member States had been developing a blueprint for economic , social and environmental action that recognized the important linkages among the various issues considered .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .  
He supported international action on the management of chemicals , including persistent organic pollutants that took account of regional variations in environmental conditions and requirements .  The goal of sustainable development would best be met by an approach that considered the interests of all members of the international community .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
It will also provide the international community with a wide and diverse database on solutions to some of the world 's most pressing social , economic and environmental problems and contribute directly to the implementation of the national and global plans of action by providing new ways and means of sharing and transferring know-how , expertise and experience .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on the urban transport , communications and energy sectors , and particular attention should be devoted to environmental policies and programmes in the developing countries with a view to improving and developing sustainable transport and communications systems , bearing in mind the respective social , economic and environmental requirements of those countries .  
His delegation believed that the international community should take strong and concerted action against terrorist groups which focused on economic targets with the potential to create environmental hazards , since such environmental damage could have global repercussions .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
provide a wide range of health services , which includes preventive , curative , health protection and promotion , environmental health and family health programmes , to meet the refugees ' basic needs and improve their overall state of health , with professional and technical assistance from the World Health Organization ;  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .  
In conclusion , he stressed that the profound political and economic changes that had occurred in recent years had confirmed that peace , economic growth , environmental protection , social justice and democracy were all closely interdependent .  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account .

Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
downward trend recorded over the last three budgets and the absence of links between financial commitments and programming had aroused concerns and led to questioning as to whether environmental concerns had been recognized as having equal importance with social and economic concerns .  The Governing Council had again called on all Governments to contribute voluntarily to the Environment Fund in time to permit implementation of the planned activities .  
could also ensure the proper implementation of existing international environmental agreements , which their countries often rushed to sign without adopting the required enabling legislation .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
We propose that at its scheduled December 1996 meeting , the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl specify the phases and modalities for advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes in order to ensure the sustainable economic and social development of Belarus and other most severely affected countries in transition , which find themselves in a critical situation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
Within the framework of its inputs to ongoing and planned global environmental programmes such as GTOS , FAO will continue its cooperation with organizations within the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other international organizations by providing remote sensing expertise and by participating in pilot studies in areas within its mandate . 
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
She reaffirmed that the United States understood the term " sustained economic growth " as referring to " growth in the context of sustainable development " , consistent with paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development , which read as follows : " We are convinced that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
A particular weakness relates to understanding the interlinkages between economic activities and their social and environmental impacts , which can be distant in space and time ( though the knowledge base concerning the relationship between human activities and climate change has improved significantly in recent years ( see the report of the Secretary-General on chapter 9 of Agenda 21 ( Protection of the atmosphere ) ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 2 ) ) ) .  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
Promote the active participation of all stakeholders , including those in isolated and remote communities , in ensuring the integrated consideration of the environmental , social and economic objectives of rural development efforts ;  
There is a sense of great opportunity and hope that a new world can be built in which economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development can be realized through solidarity and cooperation within and between countries , and through effective partnerships at all levels .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Ensure that clean water is available and accessible to all human settlements by the year 2000 through , inter alia , the adoption and improvement of technology , and ensure that environmental protection and conservation plans are designed and implemented to restore polluted water systems and rebuild damaged watersheds ;  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
It was stated that the objectives of an emergency monitoring system were : ( a ) to provide national protection agencies and relevant research institutions with information to support strategic and emergency decisions ; ( b ) to re-establish the telecommunications and environmental data collection systems when an event had occurred in order to coordinate the local relief operations from the coordinating centre and to collect real-time environmental data ; and ( c ) to assess real-time and a posteriori damages , data that would be useful for understanding the phenomenon and its consequences .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
They reflect a recognition of the need to move away from the treatment of fields of international law ( relating , for example , to human rights , economic relations , environmental protection ) as being self-contained , towards the development of general rules of international law in which those separate fields retain their distinct character but are subject to an interconnected approach .  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
The Office has documented numerous case-studies worldwide of management and technical changes that have led to reduced environmental impacts and improved economic performance .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
The former involves the need to clarify and strengthen the relationship between existing international instruments or agreements in the field of environment and relevant social and economic agreements or instruments ; the latter , the aim of identifying and preventing , or resolving , where necessary , actual or potential conflicts , particularly between environmental and social / economic agreements or instruments , with a view to ensuring that such agreements or instruments are consistent .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
Improved access to private capital will be a key to success in providing EST opportunities for and improving the environmental performance of SMEs . Such companies have difficulties in remaining competitive in the rapidly expanding international marketplace .  
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
Conflicts have not been resolved by markets , and the water administration is to a large extent unable to address them ; ( g ) Water legislation should include water marketing principles , established within a balanced structure in which property protected water rights are accommodated to public interest , including the principle of effective and beneficial use and environmental protection .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The ongoing policy formulation with respect to mineral tenure development , investment codes , legal and fiscal frameworks , environmental management and social development is essential , along with the subsequent formalization through the legal system .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
Take note of the progress report , submitted by UNCTAD , of the analytical study on the relationship of environmental protection to international competitiveness , job creation and development , and invite UNCTAD to elaborate on the study , with the contributions of Governments , regional economic integration organizations , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and other relevant regional and international organizations , and to submit the results to the Commission at its fifth session , in 1997 .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
The main obstacle to the wide utilization of both energy efficiency measures and renewable sources of energy , including , solar , wind and tidal energy technologies , is the competitive advantage of fossil fuels , which is likely to prevail as long as their environmental costs are not internalized .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
First world environmental standards are becoming increasingly stringent and have moved from regulating obvious pollutants such as sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , to controlling , for example , the quality and quantity of industrial wastes , the transboundary shipment of hazardous wastes , acid mine drainage , and heavy metals releases .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group took note that concerning offshore oil and gas activities , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) had concluded that harmonized environmental regulations had been and were being developed in specific regional programmes , and such discussions were proving productive .  
Undertake research that is specific to women in a number of health areas , for example reproductive health ( including contraceptive research and development ) , as well as research on substance abuse , occupational health , environmental health , adolescent health , tuberculosis and tropical diseases , including any gender-specific determinants , disease patterns and consequences , with a view to making recommendations on health policy and programme improvements designed to ensure optimal health for men and women ( WHO , UNDCP ) .  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Noting that it is essential that strategies to move to sustainable consumption and production patterns of minerals be linked to strategies to maintain supply , and that the goal of ensuring optimal and efficient use of available resources with minimum environmental impact requires that the demand be met from the most efficient sources world wide ,  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
The ESCAP secretariat continued to monitor , review and analyse the economic and social development situation in the region and disseminated relevant information to policy makers and others to make possible better understanding of the macroeconomic policies conducive to sustained economic growth , poverty alleviation and the integration of environmental concerns into macroeconomic decision - and policy-making processes .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .  
In relation to " administering the resources of the Area " , in view of the interest of member States in conservation and rational management in the development of the resources of the Area , the Authority needs an effective and sustained effort to collect , manage and distribute information on the Area in order , inter alia , to provide an adequate understanding of the environmental impact likely to be caused by deep seabed mining , estimate the magnitude of the polymetallic nodule resources in the world 's oceans  
As to the specific proposal raised by Malta ( see A / 50 / 142 ) , the question of how the United Nations machinery for dealing with international environmental issues should be developed is a very important substantive issue that needs to be addressed in the first instance by the policy machinery that the General Assembly has set up to consider coordination of environmental and development issues - the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
Therefore , one can not find in the draft articles concepts such as water basin or integrated management . one can see sufficiently enshrined neither substantive principles such as sustainable development , precaution and preventive action nor their procedural corollaries : the requirement of environmental impact assessments , of transparency , of broadly informing and notifying the public and of consultation and negotiation on the impact of planned measures . 
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
After 10 years of assessment and monitoring of forest condition , knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of forest damage has grown considerably , and public awareness of air pollution as a threat to the environment and notably to forests has increased , providing an impetus for new national and international environmental policies and expanded research into forest damage .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .

This strategy outlines Panama 's policy on maritime matters , with regard to its legal , scientific , economic and environmental aspects , and indicates the principles and purposes that guide the Panamanian State in its efforts to integrate itself in regional and international maritime activities in accordance with domestic legislation and international law .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
The GEF provides new and additional grants and funding to meet the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits in four focal areas : ( a ) the protection of biological diversity , ( b ) the reduction of greenhouse gases , ( c ) the protection of international waters , and ( d ) the protection of the ozone layer .  
His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club ; however , the approach must be broadened , bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments .  There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
The United Nations system had been a major actor in promoting a holistic approach to development - linking social , economic and environmental considerations - in all the developing countries , as evidenced by the organization and outcome of a number of international conferences , especially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the International Conference on Population and Development , the World Summit for Social Development , and the Fourth World Conference on Women . 
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
The Polessk State Radiation and Environmental Reserve , located in Belarus on territory directly adjacent to the Chernobyl nuclear power station , possesses appropriate infrastructure , including highly qualified scientists and experts , and has unique conditions and research subjects , thus making it possible to develop practical approaches and establish effective methods of overcoming the consequences of nuclear disasters and ensuring environmental rehabilitation of territories polluted by radionuclides . 
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
It therefore welcomed the set of measures outlined in subprogramme 5.4 ( Sustainable development ) which was intended to develop a comprehensive framework for the more effective integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development embracing the relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral components of Agenda 21 and incorporating the results of other major United Nations conferences held in recent years .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;

The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The milestones reported were the following : ( a ) Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) : the enhancement of the capability to generate reliable and timely environmental statistics and indicators ; ( b ) Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) : the development and strengthening of the national capabilities of the statistical offices in the region so that the regular and systematic collection of a minimum set of environmental statistics and indicators for a selected group of countries in the region could be achieved ;  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,

While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The environmental policy sought to reconcile economic development with natural resource conservation and to make the high quality of the environment a key element in supporting the country 's economic and social development .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , including : consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy-saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce firewood collection ; and controlled firewood harvesting .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
Today it is universally accepted that sustainable development could be attained if it were approached in a comprehensive manner , and that sustained economic growth is closely linked with social development and environmental protection .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
At a time when the international community is struggling to deal with the problems of environmental degradation resulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel , the Agency 's achievements in the area of nuclear safety underline the merits of nuclear energy as the most feasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Five years have elapsed since we signed the historic Rio Declaration and agreed to a series of commitments , contained in Agenda 21 , on economic , social and environmental development .  
It will be composed of 29 members , of whom 14 will be drawn from the Government 10 of them ministers and 15 from the business , labour and academic spheres ; local authorities ; non-governmental organizations from the economic , social and environmental spheres ; congressional representatives ; and three independent members .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
The effectiveness of waste - management policies may be enhanced when combined with economic and environmental policies designed to improve , for example , efficiency in production and consumption and with policies targeted at making production processes and consumer choice and behaviour more suitable .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
To address the issue of the lack of the critical long-term data necessary to understand global environmental problems , international organizations and the scientific community have designed observing systems to make data collection more coherent and cost-effective .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
Some of those concerns were raised in an input made by the Non-Governmental Organizations Caucus on Transnational Corporations , composed of 27 non-governmental organizations with a wide membership around the world , focusing on the growing dependence on voluntary corporate environmental practices at the expense of the diminishing role of Governments in overseeing and monitoring corporate responsibility .  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
Human rights violations have been reported , in addition to sporadic and discretionary enforcement of environmental regulations : reportedly , unlined toxic waste pits allow pollution to seep into drinking water supplies , thus threatening the right to health of surrounding communities , and calls for compensation from the oil companies are often met with claims of sabotage or payment of compensation to the Government of which the local villagers see little . 
The company is also held responsible for environmental damage ranging from devastating a protected forest , to polluting a river , to damaging bridges and roads that local people use to transport their products to market . 
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
The precautionary approach is widely accepted as a fundamental concept of national environmental laws and regulations in order to protect the environment . 76 It is elaborated , for instance , in the Water Law and Planning Law of Israel , 77 in the Environmental Protection Act of the Czech Republic , 54 and is included in numerous draft environmental laws currently under consideration - for example in the Pakistan draft environmental protection act of 1996 . 
In Gambia , for example , the 1994 Act on Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides Control and Management contains a provision that international notification schemes relating to chemicals and pesticides , including the prior informed consent procedures , are to be implemented . 94 Some other examples of national legal implementation of the principle of prior consultation are directly linked to regulations regarding environmental impact assessment procedures . 
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
R &amp; amp ; D involving ICTs is yielding applications in areas such as integrated resource management , coordinated medical centres , environmental research and land management , biodiversity monitoring , biochemical engineering and molecular medicine , solar water heating and other energy conservation applications , and laboratory-based testing and standardization .  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Progress in the post-UNCED debate was attested by : the increased focus on exploring the scope of complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection ; the greater degree of confidence built up between the environmental and trade communities ; a balanced and integrated approach to the trade and environment agenda encouraged by the international community ; and , the work programmes of UNCTAD , WTO and UNEP which , together with the Commission on Sustainable Development , had clearly anchored the objectives of sustainable development and the trade and environment theme .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Comparisons of the two types of solutions considered at the preliminary pilot project stage provided ample confirmation that the " tunnel " option was more realistic and advantageous , from the technical , economic and environmental standpoint , than the " bridge " option .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the Pacific island developing countries related to their isolation , small size and vulnerability to environmental hazards have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and other international declarations .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session , recognized that the " management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests are a crucial factor in economic and social development , in environmental protection and in the planet 's life-support system .  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among other things , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
An important outcome of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction was the recognition of the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21.2 More specifically , the Conference reaffirmed Principle 18 of the Rio Declaration , 3 which stressed the need for the international community to assist States afflicted by natural disasters and other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects to the environment . 
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
The activities included the enhancement of statistical methodologies , which were vital in evaluating the Institutes programmes and projects ; the preparation of a multi-media modular package on women , environmental management and sustainable development , in cooperation with the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization in Turin ; and the drafting , currently in progress , of a manual to assist womens organizations in maximizing the use of computer-mediated communication technologies in all their activities .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
After extensive work involving inspections , analysis of large volumes of documentation and of information received from Member States and former suppliers of relevant items , the use of new techniques for environmental monitoring , questioning of Iraqi staff and examination of items recovered from excavations , we have been able to construct a technically coherent picture of Iraq 's past nuclear programme and to gain a good understanding of the scope of the achievements of the programme .  
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .  
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
Israel reported that at the criminal supervisory level , a well-equipped and highly mobile " environmental patrol " , staffed by trained personnel authorized with police officers ' powers , operated within the Ministry of the Environment .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
First , while the earlier debate was characterized largely by fears of important contradictions between trade and environment policies , the post-UNCED debate has focused on exploring the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection , and has enlarged the development dimension in the discussion on most issues .  Conceptual and empirical analyses and debate have helped to set aside some of the early fears of incompatibility between trade and environment policies which could have induced inappropriate policy choices .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .  Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti 's long-term development , meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental , agricultural , educational and administrative reform programmes .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
The Guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , which include ; consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce fuelwood collection ; and controlled fuelwood harvesting .  
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
This includes improved contribution to the work of those bodies on the development and updating of a wide range of international legal instruments , regulations and recommendations that provide a common technical and legal basis for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks , for the improvement of the efficiency , safety and environmental performance of the transport sector and for the facilitation of border crossing .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Seven projects on modern techniques and technologies for the development of both surface and groundwater resources ; use of alternative sources of energy ; new and renewable energy technologies ; and improving the efficiency of resource use , minimizing waste and maximizing recycling and environmental protection ;  
Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;  
Although , in the Declaration adopted by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore , Ministers rejected the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and agreed that the comparative advantage of countries , particularly low-wage developing countries , must in no way be put into question , the continuing calls for higher labour , social and environmental standards are seen by many in developing countries as a way of promoting new and disguised forms of protectionism .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development2 - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
While it is true that appropriate technologies to limit environmental degradation and reverse the trend can easily be identified , the fact remains that the connection between environmental degradation and egotistically driven consumption which , though it serves as an impetus to economic growth , does not apportion properly the resulting benefits remains to be made , notwithstanding all the fine words to the contrary .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Thus , Cameroon , for its part , has worked to develop internal legal provisions and appropriate structures , including , in particular , a law on the forest and animal regime ; the institutionalization and organization of educational seminars on environmental problems ; the creation of a national advisory commission for environment and sustainable development ; and the development of a national plan of action for environmental management .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
It should be recalled that the alternative site given to the Jahalin is located on rocky and windy land 500 metres from the Jerusalem garbage dump and was declared by an Israeli environmental study to be unfit for human habitation .  
Only an efficient universal organization can help us cope with the pressing challenges of globalization , economic and social development , environmental changes and the urgent need to protect and respect human rights .  
On the eve of the new millennium , I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic , environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States .  
Transnational corporations now have greater freedom to set up in countries where , owing to political , economic or social constraints or a lack of human and financial resources , environmental legislation is rudimentary , non _ existent or poorly enforced .  
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
Thus , solidarity was the precondition for a lasting solution to all crises political , economic and environmental that threatened international peace and stability and undermined the chances for genuine and sustainable development for all .  
In developing a national legislation , it has been found convenient to first construct an umbrella or a framework environmental law which lays down the basic legal principles without attempting to codify all relevant statutory provisions .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
In the next century , the planet Earth faces the potential hazard of rapid environmental changes , including global warming , rising mean sea level , deforestation , desertification and land degradation , ozone depletion , acid rain and a reduction in biodiversity .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
Reaffirming the need to incorporate sustainable development strategies , since they are essential to achieving economic , social , and environmental goals in a balanced and complementary manner ,  
Twenty-one per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 22 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Principle 11 of the Rio Declaration stated that environmental standards applied by some countries might be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries , in particular developing countries .  
The devastating social , economic and environmental impact of anti-personnel mines and their detrimental effects on the creation of conditions conducive to sustainable development is well documented .  
In conclusion , he said that he wished to reiterate that UNEP needed a solid financial base in order to discharge its strengthened mandate and meet the growing environmental challenges worldwide .  
Other environmental health risks such as unsafe uses of lead , tobacco and ambient and indoor air pollution need to be adequately addressed in local , national and regional preventive strategies with a view to reducing their potential effects .  
UNCTAD has also concluded that it is not practical to prescribe a specific curriculum for general knowledge since this is a function of many different cultural , sociological and environmental factors , and should be decided at the national level .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
It is the task of the national statistical system to make available to government , the public and the private sector relevant and reliable statistical information for economic , social , cultural and environmental developments in a country ;  
It has encouraged extensive public participation , set up a mechanism of institutional guarantees , engaged extensively in international cooperation , and made notable progress in environmental protection as well as in economic and social development . 
Twenty per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 16 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
If there is no determined international concerted effort to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the poor , then we will have the classical scenario of poverty breeding environmental decay .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
Energy plays a key role in achieving the economic , social and environmental objective of sustainable development , and the supply of energy must be secure and reliable .  
Firmly convinced of the environmental , economic , social and cultural importance of all types of forests , Liechtenstein supports all efforts aimed at establishing an international , legally binding , comprehensive and coherent instrument on sustainable forest management .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
This Alliance represents a regional and national strategy whose basic principle is to bring about integral changes in Central American economic , social , cultural and environmental development , with every aspect geared towards respecting all forms of life , improving the quality of life , preserving and respecting the diversity of the planet and our region and respecting human rights and multiculturalism in our region .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
Since its establishment by the General Assembly in 1963 , it had advised United Nations bodies , the national institutions of Member States and non-governmental organizations through training programmes in a variety of disciplines ( multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management , peacemaking and preventive diplomacy , environmental law , migration policy and law , capacity-building in the field of economic and social development ) .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
Provision of technical advisory services to Member States , as well as international and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science , satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in these fields , upon request ( 8 to 10 per year ) .  
The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
Providing advisory services to sensitize Governments with regard to the need to incorporate in the Constitution , in framework environmental laws or in international environmental instruments , provisions on the individual 's right to a clean and healthy environment , access to justice and information - including prior informed consent procedures - public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters ;  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
As far as his country was concerned , the efforts to reduce poverty and ensure social peace had been based on the plans of action formulated at the major United Nations conferences , and were aimed at achieving a form of development which reconciled growth and environmental protection , while ensuring a decent minimum income and the exercise of basic human rights for all citizens .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
While continuing to provide regional comparable statistics and indicators needed for assessing and monitoring progress achieved in sustainable development in the ESCWA region , during the biennium 20002001 , the subprogramme will concentrate on upgrading these services to better respond to the renewed and growing interest in statistics and indicators covering a wide range of economic , social and , for the first time , environmental concerns associated with sustainable development .  
In collaboration with appropriate United Nations and external partners , the subprogramme will alert the world to emerging problems by initiating periodic assessments of priority environmental issues , strengthening linkages to global and national environmental observation programmes and helping to provide authoritative information for policy formulation and implementation . 
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assistance to Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels that address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Reflection and presentation of a timely , accurate , appropriate image of UNEP through systematic dissemination of targeted information on the environmental agenda and initiatives to enlist audience support through the media , and assistance in mobilizing adequate international response to major emerging environmental issues ;  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
During the biennium 20002001 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
Reasons for this unsustainable pattern of development in the ESCWA region include poor institutional arrangements , deficiency in environmental , economic and social information , a lack of public participation in the decision-making process , and severe inadequacy in institutional capacities and qualified human resources .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
While the operator was to be generally held liable for damage , a problem arose in respect of a provision imposing on the operator an obligation of reasonable compensation for unrepaired damage or irreparable harm or where response action was not possible , not feasible or , for environmental or other reasons , not desirable .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all . 
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
Satellites are today an essential tool for weather forecasting , direct television broadcasting , telecommunications , geographical positioning , air , sea and land traffic control , environmental protection and many other operations that are increasing in number and producing a broad economic and social impact .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Numerous international documents have been severely violated by the unprovoked and illegal NATO aggression : the Charter of the United Nations , the humanitarian law provisions , especially the Geneva Conventions with the related protocols , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , provisions of international agreement in the field of the environment , as well as the basic proclaimed principles of environmental protection .  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
Accord appropriate priority to inland water transport in policy , planning and investment based on detailed analysis of the economic , financial , social and environmental benefits , and to promote public awareness of such benefits , thereby encouraging a modal shift to inland water transport , where appropriate ;  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
Problems requiring special attention include : health effects , where there is a confirmed increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer , in particular , in those who were children at the time of the accident ; environmental problems , such as the reuse of contaminated forests , contaminated food and water pollution ; psychological impact on the population ; and social and economic rehabilitation of the affected areas .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Also notes the need to secure the participation of a diverse range of stakeholders drawn from government , non-governmental organizations , academia , centres of excellence , professional bodies and business enterprises in a partnership arrangement aimed at providing an integrated environmental information service at the national level , and encourages Governments to establish these partnerships under a formal agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme ;  
Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
During the two phases , it is very important to obtain sufficient information from the potential mining sites ( commonly termed " baseline data " ) to document clearly the natural conditions which exist prior to mining , and to gain insights into the natural processes such as dispersion and settling of particles , and benthic faunal succession , and to gather other data which will make it possible to acquire the necessary predictive capability for accurate environmental impact prediction .  
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Space environmental exploration and research has been carried out on energy electrons , protons , heavy ions and their single particle effects , radiation dosage effects , space thermal plasma , upper atmospheric density and components and solar energy electromagnetic radiation .  
If the distinction had become commonplace in international law at the doctrinal level , it would be worthwhile searching for further applications of the concept , for example , by considering areas such as the law of the sea , environmental law and diplomatic law .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
India considers that the integration of environmental and developmental concerns is essential for the fulfilment of basic needs and ensuring improved living standards for all , better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer and more prosperous future .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
My country attached the utmost importance to the Cairo Conference , both in its own right and as a part of a global strategy for the promotion of sustainable development , which takes into account the recognized linkages between population , environmental protection and economic and social development .  
The objectives of the Government in oil refining are : to increase lubrication oil production to meet overall local demand ; to improve the quality of refined products by reducing sulphur contents in gas oil and kerosene and the necessity for lead compounds in gasoline ; to improve safety standards and fire - fighting capabilities ; to improve environmental protection by enhanced treatment to effluent water and gas emissions ; and to increase operating efficiency in general .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The objective of the meeting was to formulate an environmental studies model to encourage cooperation among States , national scientific institutions , the registered pioneer investors and potential contractors in research on environmental predictions for deep seabed mining .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
He stressed in particular the need for prior consultation and full participation of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of energy projects , for compensation and benefit _ sharing , and for sociocultural impact studies to be integrated into the normal environmental impact assessments .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .  
The resulting Antigua Declaration , adopted on 11 March , recognizes the impact of Hurricane Mitch and , in supporting the reconstruction and transformation initiative , reaffirms shared values of democracy , the free market , respect for human rights and fundamental liberties , the rule of law , the struggle against international crime and a commitment to environmental protection .  
During the past year , the priorities of ALIDES have been advanced through a wide range of initiatives and meetings at various levels of government , encompassing the social sector , public finance and economic growth , environmental protection and sustainable development , and the strengthening of SICA and other regional institutions as a means of pursuing the goals of ALIDES .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,  
Alternative 1 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response [ to natural disasters as well as the need to contain ] [ aimed at containing ] environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Alternative 2 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms in order to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
It identified five areas of concentration : ( i ) environmental information , assessment and research , including environmental emergency response capacity and strengthening of early warning and assessment functions ; ( ii ) enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; ( iii ) fresh water ; ( iv ) technology transfer and industry ; and ( v ) support to Africa ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Provision of advisory services to 16 countries for the development of legislative proposals to implement selected environmental agreements that address identified environmental and sustainable development issues ( through national task forces , consultants , technical backstopping and national consensus-building forums ) ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
the implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements - such as the Montreal Protocol , the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( FCCC ) , the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) - in a manner consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as they are being concluded , signed and ratified , taking into account core environmental principles such as the precautionary principle ;  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
One of the fundamental principles of the Programme was that the formulation and implementation of population-related policies is the responsibility of each country and should take into account the economic , social and environmental diversity of conditions in each country , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of its people ( A / CONF . 171 / 13 , article 1.11 ) .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of national and local initiatives in Norway , a preparatory process to implement Agenda 21 in local communities was already under way and of a holistic , cross-sectoral approach that integrated environmental , economic and social concerns .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Endeavours are being made to achieve this goal through the programmes and activities of the primary health-care institutions ( primary health services , maternal care and family planning , immunization against contagious and endemic diseases , environmental health , promotion of healthy nutrition , provision of a safe water supply , health education , oral and dental hygiene and care of the aged ) . 
This is illustrated by the " healthy villages " project , a community-based project designed , sponsored and monitored by the Ministry of Health and adopted by the village community , with assistance from other public bodies , with a view to improving all aspects of village living conditions , particularly in the health , environmental , social and economic fields .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
In the field of operational activities , considerable progress had been made during the triennial policy review towards formalizing the view that human centred development included economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
The European Union attached great importance to the commitments made by all countries and major groups to the implementation of the principles of the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 ; it believed that the enhancement of public awareness was essential and engaged in continuous dialogue with civil society on environmental matters .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The orbital network of spacecraft operated by Russia was carrying out assignments in a range of basic areas , including implementation of international agreements , organization of manned orbital flights and operation of new industrial technology in space , conduct of basic scientific research , creation of global communications and television broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia , and also environmental monitoring and disaster management .  
Plays an active role in developing and facilitating consultations with Governments , including through permanent missions accredited to UNEP in Nairobi , leading to better understanding of Governments expectations and environmental needs , and keeps Governments informed of UNEPs ongoing activities and plans ;  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
They include activities such as environmental planning , use of the geographical information system ( GIS ) , the global positioning system ( GPS ) and satellite images in environmental assessment and monitoring , demarcation of protected areas , guided firewood harvesting , promotion of energy-efficient cooking devices and practices , erosion control , tree planting , agroforestry , and environmental education and awareness raising .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
It is also demonstrated by our vigorous efforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional wisdom of the past , which sacrificed environmental concerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic growth . 
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
We are fully convinced that the United Nations , as the most representative and democratic of international organizations , remains the international forum most qualified to deal with the effects of globalization in the economic , social and environmental areas , as well as with questions of equality and fairness between the sexes .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The Commission is therefore convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach is required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at intergovernmental and inter-agency levels .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
In addition , the design and development are lacking of a common strategy for energy-related activities in the system aimed at promoting a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and of fostering partnership for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
At both the national and international levels , it was essential that Governments and non-governmental organizations alike should fight for democracy and the elimination of poverty and social exclusion as matters of priority.They should also focus on guaranteeing other emerging rights of cardinal importance for future generations like environmental protection .  
The apparent economic and technical obsolescence of a major part of the fleet is necessarily reflected in higher operating costs , as repair and maintenance rapidly increase with age , schedule delays and unreliability , and greater environmental risks associated with obsolete vessels .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
Work at the national and international levels in recent years has focused on a number of promising strategies for changing consumption and production patterns , including internalizing environmental and social costs in market prices , removing subsidies for unsustainable production and consumption activities , and integrating environmental and social goals in economic policy-making .  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
By the early 1990 s , national tourism authorities had generally come to realize that the economic benefits of tourism would not be achievable in the long run unless tourism was properly planned and managed to include an explicit concern for the social and environmental assets upon which its future prosperity depended .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
In Mauritius , a national environmental commission has been set up , chaired by the Prime Minister , with a broad membership , including ministers responsible for economic planning , finance , education , science and technology , energy and natural resources , tourism , industry , health and justice , and representatives of local government .  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
The realization of the right to adequate food is inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , both at the national and international level , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant governmental agency conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
In spite of the constraints encountered , many small island developing States have established initiatives to balance tourism activities with broader economic , social and environmental objectives at the regional , national and local levels .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
Much of the effort thus far has centred on understanding the crucial role of sound environmental management for the sustainability of socio-economic development ; on coming to grips with the multitude of environmental issues calling for attention ; on raising public awareness of the importance of protecting environmental assets ; and on the exploration of strategies , policies and measures for integrating environmental dimensions into socio-economic planning and development practices .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In accordance with resolution 1998-46 , the Committee is to be composed of 24 independent experts , with expertise drawn from the fields of economic development , social development and environmental protection , and reflect adequate geographical and gender balance .  
Urban governance , which is defined by how well a population , its representatives and agents identify and deal with the major social , economic and environmental issues , is greatly improved when it is characterized by multi-stakeholder strategic planning , participatory management and the promotion of civic values .  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Promote , through educational and other programmes , efforts aimed at better informing the population about the urgent problems of environmental protection , rational nature management and improving the living environment for current and future generations.For the Republic of Kazakhstan : 
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,

The topics of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law and of State responsibility were closely related to environmental protection , a subject which was being dealt with in various specialized bodies where solutions were tailored to specific environmental problems .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Likewise , new safety and environmental standards impose on building owners major obligations to retrofit existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , handicap access , interior air quality , asbestos abatement , shielding of electromagnetic fields , elimination of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) compounds , and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
Points of public concern include matters such as continuity in the provision of public services ; adherence to environmental protection , health , safety and quality standards set by the host country ; fairness of prices charged to the public ; non-discriminatory treatment of customers or users , full disclosure of information pertaining to the operation of infrastructure facilities and the flexibility needed to meet changed conditions , including expansion of the service to meet additional demand .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Distance learning instruction is supplemented by specialized inaugural or followup workshops held at the national or regional level along with selected intensive efforts for environmental law capacitybuilding at national level .  
The unique role of the community of nongovernmental organizations , at local , regional , national and international levels , in putting environmental issues on the agenda and promoting social innovation was recognized .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .  
Our common objective is to meet the ever increasing needs of human development in the economic and social spheres , while not simply preserving , but gradually restoring natural ecosystems to conditions that will guarantee environmental sustainability .  
The vast oceanic area under the control of our members is rich in fishing potential but requires careful management and monitoring to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing and other environmental threats .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
The fast pace of globalization , the competition for FDI and the sheer size of many transnational corporations ( TNCs ) can make it difficult for a host country acting alone to set in place adequate environmental controls over incoming FDI .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Tectonic and environmental hazard mapping of the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault system using a digital elevation model ( DEM ) from ESA remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) tandem mission synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data ( international ) ;  
Parallel to the understanding of the indivisible nature of human rights is an understanding of the integrated political , economic , social , cultural and environmental nature of development .  
Such a system must also include the principles of diversity and holistic and integrated development , based not only on economic but also on political , social , gender , cultural and environmental dimensions .  
This new framework is a holistic and integrated approach to development strategies and programs that highlights the interdependence of all aspects of development strategy : social , human , institutional , environmental , economic and financial .  
According to a recent white paper , the latter had moved all its dependent Territories from their former colonial status into a modern partnership status that extended to administrative , economic , social and environmental matters .  
It had also been recognized that the industrialized countries should take urgent measures , both corrective and preventive , to resolve pressing global environmental problems .  
Capacity 21 was another UNDP innovative initiative , which dated from 1993 and was aimed at facilitating the integration of economic , social and environmental considerations into national programmes for sustainable development .  
She also raised the legal , economic , social , human and environmental problems caused by the export of contaminated ships destined for scrap in developing countries .  
The new functional organizational structure , which was considered and endorsed by the special session of the Governing Council held in May 1998 , indicates that UNEP is addressing all environmental issues in a holistic and integrated manner .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
Thus , it should be stressed that sustainable participatory development would not , then , be fully achieved , as it remains conditional on political , economic and social , environmental and cultural sustainability .  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
The plan defined the legal , normative , organizational , economic , scientific , technical , environmental and social aspects of such cooperation as well as its main policies and tasks .

Stop imposing economic sanctions , which deprive people of their basic economic , social and environmental rights and which make their struggle for survival , as well as for civil and political rights , more difficult . 
The report demonstrates that coordinated implementation of the environmental conventions is essential at the local level , where it is possible to make a significant difference and where tangible benefits are not only easily achievable but also demonstrable .  
UNEP has also recognized that a strong regional architecture is central to its ability to manage and advance the larger global environmental agenda and has accordingly enhanced its regional presence .  
The meeting , attended by representatives of global and regional multilateral environmental conventions , identified potential areas for collaboration among those conventions on topics such as assessment , trade and streamlining of national reporting .  
It was essential that the Conference should be based on a global approach to development , that reflected not only basic economic aspects but also the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
While all States agreed that the environment must be protected and that potentially harmful activities must be regulated , environmental standards and national financial capacities varied and it would be difficult to establish a minimum standard of conduct .  
The focus should be placed on the social , economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development , as expressed in broad themes recognized as the main challenges before the international community .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
Economic , social and environmental linkages essential for achieving SHD have been widely acknowledged yet applied methodologies and practical tools to address these linkages are not fully reflected in macroeconomic reform processes and framework setting .  
The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , almost 15 years ago , affected almost the entire territory of Europe but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation and caused long-lasting , complex problems .  The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
By decision 21 / 21 , the Council decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental group of ministers or their representatives , with the Executive Director as an ex officio member , to undertake a comprehensive policy-oriented assessment of existing institutional weaknesses as well as future needs and options for strengthened international environmental governance , including the financing of UNEP , with a view to presenting a report containing analysis and options to the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum .  
Also concerned about the increasing number of emerging and crisis situations in the world , particularly in Africa as a result of global environmental changes with adverse social , cultural and economic effects ,  
Emphasizing that stable , predictable and adequate funding is a prerequisite for improved governance and should constitute a central aspect of deliberations on improving international environmental governance ,  
Recalling the recommendations from the Malm Ministerial Declaration 2 / that the 2002 World Summit should review the requirements for a greatly strengthened institutional structure for international environmental governance based on an assessment of future needs for an institutional architecture that has the capacity to effectively address wide-ranging environmental threats in a globalizing world , and that United Nations Environment Programmes role in this regard should be strengthened and its financial base broadened and made more predictable ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The political , economic , environmental , social , humanitarian , information and many other components of preventive activities are coming to the fore .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
Recommendations emanating from the Workshop are expected to focus on future needs for the regulation of space traffic , Earth-threatening asteroids and comets , global navigation satellite systems , space and the public and on the contribution of space systems to the implementation and verification of international environmental agreements .  
Unless resource management and development strategies based on space remote sensing and other information technology inputs consistent with societal demands and cultural practices were adopted on a worldwide scale , it would not be possible to ensure environmental security in the coming decades . 
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1998 / 46 , the Committee is composed of 24 independent experts with expertise drawn from the fields of economic development , social development and environmental protection and who reflect adequate geographical and gender balance .  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community .

Services cover maternal care / reproductive health , child health , curative care , dental health , health education / promotion , control of communicable diseases , prevention and control of non-communicable chronic diseases through the promotion of healthy lifestyles , and environmental health services .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
The Commission also encouraged Governments to take into consideration the health and safety concerns of women and children in rural energy programmes , and to promote efforts to address the disproportionate burdens experienced by women in rural areas in access to energy supply .  Governments were encouraged to improve policies that reduce environmental health hazards , including through plans and strategies to prevent , mitigate and respond to diseases resulting from indoor and outdoor air pollution , giving special attention to the health of women and children .  
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
The UNDP Environment Policy Adviser and the Procurement Adviser have developed basic environmental guidelines , an overview of the key issues involved , sources of detailed and reliable information and generic recommendations on major procurement items for use by the Advisory Committee on Procurement and country offices .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
Slovakia fully supported the continuation of UNIDOs successful transformation in order to increase the impact , relevance and usefulness of the Organization in its task of promoting responsible and sustainable industrial development , as a means of achieving economic well-being and social development while ensuring environmental sustainability .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;

This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
In many cities , confronted with rapid growth , environmental problems and the slow pace of economic development , it has not been possible to generate sufficient employment , provide adequate housing and meet the basic needs of the citizens .  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
The indigenous knowledge of rural women and their experience in subsistence production and environmental management should be recognized by national and local governments and development experts as a resource , and should be integrated into formal programmes .  
The Ministry calls upon all concerned countries and specialized international organizations to strictly adhere to the legal regime and the constitution of Georgia , which stipulate that the Georgian supreme bodies have the exclusive right to administer a system of environmental protection , as well as legislation on land , minerals and natural resources for the whole territory of Georgia .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
The incumbent will be responsible for construction and building management in field missions and will manage a broad range of projects and contracts ranging from rental of premises , vertical / horizontal construction , sanitary and environmental projects , power supply systems , water storage , distribution and treatment systems , field defences and combat engineering activities .  
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
Express our deep conviction that religious , moral and ethical values can play a major role in addressing the global as well as the local environmental challenges facing humanity ;  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
After surveying Member States to determine the order of priority in which they would classify the various recommendations in the Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development adopted by UNISPACE III , the Committee had decided to set up 11 open-ended action teams corresponding to recommendations in priority areas that included disaster management , environmental monitoring strategy , management of Earths resources , promotion of sustainable development , space-based navigation and positioning systems , capacity-building and increasing public awareness of the importance of space activities . 
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively the long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world , in particular in developing countries ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world , in particular in developing countries ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recognizing the importance of continuing international support to the national efforts of the Governments and civil societies of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine , as the most affected countries , to mitigate and minimize the persisting negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the sustainable development of the affected areas as a result of the radiological , health , socio-economic , psychological and environmental consequences of the disaster ,  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

Believe that the strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region , the advances made in peace processes in some countries of the region and greater public awareness have helped to incorporate the environmental dimension into the development process and to make people-centred sustainable development the first priority of the political , economic and social programmes of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Regret that , although the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region have made progress in promoting a more favourable environment for technology transfer and for new clean , energy-efficient approaches to production together with the corresponding technical knowledge particularly through the establishment of suitable systems for the protection of intellectual property , the developed countries have not adopted effective measures for ensuring transfers of , in particular , the most appropriate technologies in terms of environmental , social and economic sustainability .  
Recognize that the viability of sustainable development in the region requires a stable , predictable , open and inclusive international economic system , in which the environmental dimension is acknowledged as an opportunity for investment and trade .  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Recognize that scientific research , technological innovation , and new information and communications technologies can be instrumental in the formulation of economic , social and environmental policies , and should therefore be promoted and facilitated through regional and international cooperation .  
To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To underline the fact that given the existing complementarities among trade , investment , environmental quality , social well-being , growth , the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources and the formation of an open and inclusive world economic system , the environmental dimension constitutes an opportunity rather than a barrier to investment and trade .  
To emphasize that the achievement of sustainable development and the improvement of the quality of life will require more effective integration of environmental , social and economic components of public policies , programmes and projects at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection , and invites them to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ( para .  25.9 ( d ) ) ;  
A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
This political will is reflected in the project for the creation of an Algerian Space Agency , which should help the country to strengthen its national capacities in economic and social development , knowledge of natural resources , environmental protection and the prevention and / or management of major disasters .  
In identifying international cooperation as one of the critical social and economic dimensions in the effort to achieve sustainable development , particularly in developing countries , chapter 2 of Agenda 21 underlines the importance of the international economys providing a supportive international climate for realizing environmental and development goals by promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization and making trade and environment mutually supportive ( para .  2.3 ) .  
With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
Mexico was taking an active part in the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance , whose work , which consisted of making a detailed analysis of current institutional weaknesses and future needs and options in terms of strengthening international environmental governance , would contribute significantly to the Summits preparatory process . 
Since environmental protection was a broad and complex issue with political , economic and social dimensions , the effective implementation of Agenda 21 required a considerable amount of resources , and its management required a multifaceted approach that balanced economic , social and environmental considerations and took into account the regional and international impact of the actions taken .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .  
In the next stages of the preparatory process , the emphasis of the debate would no doubt shift to the relationship between the environment and deepening poverty ; yet the Rio Summit had already exhausted and resolved the issue by stating in Agenda 21 that the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development were equally important .  
In that regard , it was highly advisable to avoid , during the first substantive session of the Preparatory Committee in January 2002 , perpetuating a culture which would lead either side to establish an unwarranted and inappropriate order of priority among the three pillars of sustainable development , namely , economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
The unsuitableness of some of the technology and expertise imported from the advanced countries for economic , social and environmental conditions in the Arab world , and the shortage of skilled national staff capable of working with that technology ;  
The transfer , adaptation and mastery of modern technologies in a manner suited to economic , social and environmental conditions in the Arab States ; the study of those technologies selected for import and the assessment of their applications and their possible effects ; and the remedying of any drawbacks inherent in them before they begin to be applied in the region ;

Creation of a database of regional level indicators that would make it possible to evaluate and diagnose the current state of the environment in the region ; gauge the environmental consequences of existing macroeconomic policies ; measure the economic , social and environmental costs of maintaining current development patterns ; and supply orientation for policy decisions , especially in regard to public and private investment .  
Organization of two regional training workshops for experts of national statistical offices and other public institutes responsible for official statistics , one on the production , standardization and dissemination of social statistics , social indicators and the analysis of the social situation ; and the other on the production , standardization and dissemination of environmental statistics and indicators and the analysis of the state of environment in the region ;  
Strengthening the institutional and technological capacity to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development by increasing the ability of policy makers to formulate and implement relevant legislation and environmental management plans ;  
Continuing to make available financial resources from all sources , including new and additional resources on an adequate and predictable basis and technical or other resources and facilitating and financing access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , and supporting LDCs efforts in environmental protection in the context of sustainable development ;  
Facilitate information sharing on ways Annex I Parties have striven to implement policies and measures in such a way as to minimize adverse effects , including the adverse effects of climate change , effects on international trade , and social , environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties taking into account information related to these issues provided by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ;  
All Parties , particularly developed country Parties , are urged to improve , as appropriate , the enabling environment for the transfer of environmentally sound technologies through the identification and removal of barriers , including , inter alia , strengthening environmental regulatory frameworks , enhancing legal systems , ensuring fair trade policies , utilizing tax preferences , protecting intellectual property rights and improving access to publicly funded technologies and other programmes , in order to expand commercial and public technology transfer to developing countries ;

After inquiring about the entire workflow of the live chicken trade and the detailed sanitary and environmental protection measures and holding an " on site meeting on regulating the live chicken trade activities and establishing a long-term poultry disease prevention mechanism , " Han Zheng decided to conditionally reopen Shanghai 's live chicken trade .  
These procedures mainly involve issues with regard to national security , public safety , macro manipulation , environmental protection , development and use of limited natural resources , public resource deployment , public health and interests and safety of lives and property , for which administrative licenses can be granted in line with the Administrative Licensing Law of the People 's Republic of China .  
He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .  When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc . , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
Wen Jiabao noted : The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to the management of national land and resources ; have set up a number of systems for the unified control of natural resources , including land , mineral , and marine resources ; and have made it clear that same as family planning and environmental protection , the protection and a rational use of natural resources is also considered a basic national policy of our country .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
The party committees and governments at all levels , the population , resources and environmental departments , as well as relevant departments should fully understand the extreme importance and arduousness of this work , firmly cultivate the ideology of " fighting a protracted battle , " overcome the blindly optimistic , careless and lax sentiments , and persist in grasping this work with unremitting efforts .  
We should continue to uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous attention to preventing and improving pollution and protecting the ecology , strive to control the total discharge of pollutants and strengthen pollution prevention and treatment in major cities , rivers and regional sea areas in a bid to improve environmental quality and promote ecological balance .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
Article 6 A system of controlling the total discharge volume of major pollutants may be instituted for a body of water that still falls short of the water environmental quality standards set by the state even after its water pollutant discharge quotas have been fulfilled .  
Total discharge volume control plans for the state-defined major river basins shall be drawn up by the State Council 's environmental protection department in conjunction with relevant departments of the State Council after consulting with the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned and be submitted to the State Council for approval .  
Total discharge volume control plans for other water bodies shall be drawn up by the environmental protection departments of the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in conjunction with relevant departments of the same level after consulting with the local people 's governments concerned and be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's government for approval .  
Article 12 The people 's governments of provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities located in the state-defined major river basins shall enforce State Council-approved water environmental quality standards that are applicable to water bodies that cut across provincial boundaries .  
and other circumstances .  It shall , after having made a thorough investigation of the accident , make a written report to the local environmental protection department on the cause , course , and harms of the accident ; measures taken in and results of handling the accident ; potential or indirect harms and social impact of and problems left over by the accident ; preventive measures ; and other circumstances and shall enclose with it relevant supporting documents .  
In the event of their failure in delimitation through consultation , the environmental protection department of the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government , in conjunction with the water resources , land and natural resources , health , construction , and other relevant departments of the same level , shall propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Those who violate the provisions in Article 23 , Section 3 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by setting up a wharf for loading and unloading garbage , oils , and other toxic and harmful matter in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to demolish the wharf within a time limit and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
Article 47 Those who violate the provisions in Article 33 , Item ( 4 ) of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by using pores , fissures , and karst caves in the aquifer and abandoned mine pits for storing petroleum , radioactive matter , toxic chemicals , or pesticide shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to correct the mistake and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
It is necessary to further clearly define the major objectives , basic tasks and major principles and policies for developing the minority nationalities areas , and promote population , resources , environmental , as well as economic and social development in a coordinated and stage-by-stage manner and with an objective in mind . "  
The targets for controlling COD , nitrogen , phosphorus , and petroleum should comprehensively attain the requirements for controlling the volume and the total amount of pollutants ; the water quality of near-shore water areas should comprehensively attain the defined environmental protection targets in areas according to their functions .  The ecology should basically realize a benign cycle , and the environment of a number of key sea areas should be comprehensively improved .  
For instance , the United States pursued a " key control points " registration system toward our processing factories exporting aquatic products and a " UL [ preceding acronym in Roman script - - expansion unknown ] certification system toward our home electric appliances , and the EU stipulated beginning in the early 1990s that China 's 26 export commodities , including sewing machines , should bear additional " CE " [ preceding acronym in Roman script - - expansion unknown ] and environmental protection marks .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .

The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .

Xiamen has risen and turned into one of the 10 big and medium-sized cities with strongest comprehensive economic strength and one of the eight big model cities in the field of environmental protection in the whole country .  Xiamen has been awarded one honorary title after another , including " national sanitation city , " " national garden city , " " China 's outstanding tourism city , " and so on , and has maintained coordinated economic , social , and environmental development as well .  
The Bush camp was obviously unhappy about Clinton 's " little tricks . "  Even though Bush could promulgate new administrative decrees to overturn the old ones , Bush , who has advertised himself as a " sympathetic conservative , " could counter opposition and lose public support if he tries to make major changes .  This is because Clinton 's administrative decrees involve mainly environmental protection and safety of work venues .  
During the 9th Five-Year Plan , Zhang Wannian said , the whole army scored remarkable successes in family planning and environmental protection work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission and thanks to the concerted efforts of the party committees at all levels and the broad ranks of officers and men .

On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
Plus its inexperience in administration and its confused and ambiguous financial , economic , environmental protection , and social welfare policies , all caused the worsening of the investment environment and forced a large number of enterprises to close down or move out of Taiwan .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
We must fully understand the protracted , arduous and complicated nature of pollution management and environmental improvement , and maintain healthy , stable and sustainable economic growth in our region .  A the same time , we must make efforts to do a good job at environmental protection .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
We should work out long-term plans for cooperation in accordance with the principle of ensuring mutual benefit and drawing upon each other 's strong points , explore effective concrete measures to this end , and deepen in an all-round way bilateral cooperation and exchanges in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , educational , environmental , and other fields in order to constantly widen the road of Asian-European cooperation and make fresh headway in this direction . 
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .

"  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
We must widen the extent of ecological and environmental construction in key areas including the areas around Beijing and Tianjin , the Hebei region , the Inner Mongolia region , and the northwest region .  We thus will make contributions to improving the environmental quality of the entire country , especially the region surrounding Beijing . c . )  
Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .  
An official of the education department of the Chinese Embassy in London also revealed that while Chinese environmental scientists in Britain were working in China , leaders of some local governments seemed outmoded in their thinking and tried to seek instant success , rendering unwelcome some high-tech projects designed to achieve sustainable development , especially some environmental protection research projects .  He said this phenomenon should be improved as quickly as possible .  
Second , we will establish and improve a macro regulation and control system for energy development with economic and legal means playing a dominant role while being supplemented by essential administrative measures , such as building environmental protection rules and systems , reforming the price and charge collection systems , improving tax collection and interest discount policies .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .

The continuous access of international environmental protection enterprises to China will bring along equipment with high technological contents and fine quality , which is of positive significance to enhancing the overall level of China 's environmental protection sector .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
We should adhere to the basic national policies of family planning , environmental protection , and energy conservation , increase the intensity of implementing the sustainable development strategy , control the population growth , protect and construct ecological environment , and economize on and effectively use resources so that economic and social development is genuinely built on the bases of continuous progress of science and technology , rational utilization of resources , and constant improvement of ecological environment .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
The main method to be used for this task is adopt sound environmental protection standards and technical norms and , based on these standards and norms , build a protective wall to ensure environmental protection and technological quality .

Speaking on the legislation for environmental protection , Qu Geping said : The NPC Standing Committee of the last two terms has drawn up the Flood Control Law , the law for controlling solid wastes from polluting the environment , and other laws .  With the substantive amendments made to the law for controlling atmospheric pollution , the law for protecting the maritime environment , and the law for land management , they have created a preliminary framework of laws for protecting the environment and natural resources .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .  
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
China National Space Agency the other day officially announced in Beijing the activation of its " two-satellite earth and space survey program , " saying : The program 's implementation is of great importance and significance to enhancing China 's innovation capability with regard to space physical research or space environmental forecast and raising China 's capability of ensuring safety of space activities or guarding against earth and space environmental disasters or fluctuations , and is conducive to heightening China 's earth and space survey standard or developing China 's space physics by a large margin as well . 
- investigate diseases and unusual deaths reported in wholesale and retail markets ; - improve environmental hygiene at wholesale markets ; - work on the issue of a prohibition order to prevent the importation of live chickens other than those that are derived from farms certified free from the disease by the Veterinary Officer of the exporting country .  
Announcing details of the Study on Sustainable Development for the 21st Century ( SUSDEV21 ) at a press conference today ( Monday ) , the Director of Planning , Dr Peter Pun , said : " If Hong Kong is to continue to thrive in the next century , we need to maintain our environmental quality at an acceptable level and safeguard the integrity of our natural resource base and cultural heritage while at the same time continuing to meet development pressure arising from growing social and economic needs . 
In certain busy areas , cleansing services last until mid-night .  Since the number of local residents in the New Territories has risen from 2.07 million ( 37 per cent of Hong Kong population ) to 3.11 million ( 47 per cent of Hong Kong population ) over the previous decade , the RSD opined that the standard of environmental hygiene should be improved .  
The new facility is designed and is being built to meet stringent environmental standards .  An underground waste water treatment plant is under construction for treatment of effluent generated from livestock holding and slaughter .  
In the course of treatment , some clinical staff may commit errors due to factors related to experience , professional judgement and personal or other environmental reasons .  As a result , the patients concerned may not be able to receive proper treatment .  The occurrence of these isolated mistakes can not be construed to indicate that all our frontline clinical staff lack alertness or the sense of accountability , and neither does this have any direct relation with the strength of frontline manpower resources .  
In considering the selection of the decontamination methods , the consultants have taken into account the type , extent and spread of the contamination , prevailing work safety requirements , international standards on the level of soil contamination ; and the geographical setting of the contaminated areas and any possible secondary environmental impact on the neighbourhood .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The conversion of a former illegal hawking and environmental hygiene black spot into a tidy sitting out area provides further proof that co-operation between government departments and private property management can tackle even the most intractable urban blight , a senior Home Affairs Department ( HAD ) official said today ( Saturday ) .  
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
Speaking at a press conference , the acting Director of Home Affairs , Mr Lui Hau-tuen said : " The Private Buildings Cleansing Campaign is aimed at enhancing public awareness of the importance of a healthy living environment ; improving the environmental hygiene standard of buildings ; and promoting clean buildings and clean neighbourhood .  
" Forty-seven newly completed projects will also be commissioned for use as scheduled .  A series of eye-catching exhibitions and extensive cultural , sports and recreational activities will be launched .  The Department will also enhance its environmental hygiene work to prepare for the arrival of the new millennium , and will provide a pleasant urban environment for people to enjoy , " Miss Chung said .  
The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
The brief issued to prospective consultants requires the successful consultant to identify any shortcomings in the existing requirements , conduct a comparative study of international and other relevant national requirements , identify special local factors that should be taken into account in formulating the new requirements , consider the integration of the new requirements with building form so as to enhance and encourage energy efficiency and to reduce external environmental impact , and propose new standards and the appropriate means of control .  
It is reported that the Government intends to collaborate with members of the commercial and industrial sectors to set up various action groups to identify solutions to the environmental pollution problems in Hong Kong ; and that some overseas persons have refused to take up work in Hong Kong for fear that our polluted environment will be hazardous to their health .  
I have recently received complaints from the public that some recycling bins provided by the Council are not cleared .  Hence , people who support environmental protection discover that these bins are too full for further loading when they carry the domestic waste papers and other recyclable items to the bins .  This would not only disappoint those people who support environmental protection , but would also lead to the waste papers and other recyclable items being accumulated next to the bins , resulting in stacks of refuse .  
The handbook contains information on HAD 's services , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumer rights , social order , corruption prevention , emergency services , environmental protection , The Ombudsman , Pedestrian Code , protection of intellectual property and a list of non-governmental organisations providing services for new arrivals .  
The Chief Executive stressed that the Government was determined to put in place sound policies and an effective organisation staffed by competent personnel , and to work with the green groups as partners to bring about improvements in environmental quality .  
" The contesting schools will now have to nominate a choir with no more than 60 members to compete in the final contest to be held next month , " he said .  The song contest , organised in association with the Education Department for the first year , is a health education programme aimed at raising students ' awareness of the importance of public health as well as arousing their interest in promoting personal , environmental and food hygiene through composing health-related lyrics and singing in groups .  
About 500 square metres of public open space , together with adequate private landscaped open space , at the podium level may be provided to enhance environmental quality .  
But it is also in the voters ' own interest to exercise their franchise as those elected would have a major say in determining their quality of life , such as in the areas of environmental hygiene , housing , medical services , and in the provision of public amenities , as well as recreational and sports facilities and services . "  
Based on the approved EIA report undertaken by the consultants , given that the number of vehicle trips per day is low and the material transfer station is not close to the nearby residents , no adverse environmental impacts to the nearby residents are anticipated from the operation of the works area .  
Eight sites , covering about 24.77 hectares , are zoned " Comprehensive Development Area " for medium or high density commercial / residential developments to fully utilize the development potential of those sites near the rail stations / light rail transit ( LRT ) terminus or to encourage environmental improvement in areas with existing industrial / residential interface problems .  
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
" Our recurrent expenditure on environmental protection and conservation will grow by 7.6% in real terms , reflecting additional resources for commissioning and operating new sewage treatment plants , increased payments for the disposal of waste due to the commissioning of new facilities , additional staff for implementing air quality initiatives and additional resources for new barging points and for sorting facilities for construction and demolition waste . " she added .  
Whilst the EPD shares Greenpeace 's concern on issues such as the need to control persistent organic pollutants , promote clean industry , enhance waste recovery and recycling , the EPD is very concerned that Greenpeace 's action has often done the opposite in misleading the public in understanding some key environmental issues .  
If we can become a pioneer in developing a set of innovative environmental protection technologies which are suitable for the region , we can help create a green and sustainable environment not only for our own future generations , but for our neighbours as well .  
This is examining the environmental , engineering , financial and operational aspects of alternative plans for the sewage system serving the main urban areas in order to make recommendations on the most sustainable way forward .  
Other major topics include : labour ; industry , distribution and services ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; and the environment .  
In recognition of the ecological importance of Long Valley , KCRC has carefully studied alternative alignments in addition to the gazetted alignment for the eastern end of the railway project , having regard to important factors including potential environmental impact , land use , planning requirements , engineering and operational feasibility as well as impact on local community .  
The spokesman emphasized that Government 's objective is to ensure continued reliable electricity supply at lowest reasonable cost to consumers and to balance our economic and environmental needs .  
As a further step , from next year , all major government policies and strategic proposals will be subject to sustainability impact assessments .  This will ensure that decision-makers address a wide range of consequences - economic , social and environmental - before proposals are finalised and implemented .  This will help ensure an improved quality of life for our children and future generations .  
He said , " The scope of work of the Home Affairs Bureau has a direct bearing on our daily lives .  At present , our Government has spared no efforts in promoting environmental protection , improving our living environment and implementing greening programmes to make Hong Kong a more comfortable and pleasant place .  
There were many complicated technical and architectural problems to tackle in this project , such as geotechnical structures , electrical services installations , preservation of the historical remains and natural environments as well as special environmental conditions required for the preservation and display of artefacts that have to be taken into consideration .  
In view of public concern over air quality for pedestrians , the department had been actively involved in the use of alternative environmental friendly vehicles and fuel and introduced pedestrianisation schemes in some areas to provide pedestrians with a safer , healthier and more comfortable street environment , he said .  
" They have brought their enormous creativity into full play , centering around optimization of living space and building efficiency , integration of technological and environmental concepts , and harmonization with physical environment , " Dr Cheng said , adding that the innovative ideas had rightly set a new direction for public housing development and were extremely valuable for future reference .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 19 areas , including population ; labour ; industry and commerce ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; and the environment .  
The main objective of the consultancy study is to provide a systematic reference framework to facilitate landscape assessment and broad environmental assessment of major projects at a territorial level .  
" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
For applications that have previous approvals from the Board but have been revoked because of non-compliance of planning conditions , planning permission will only be granted if the applicants have included in the submissions technical assessments or proposals to demonstrate that the proposed uses will not generate adverse drainage , environmental and traffic impacts on the surrounding areas , and the assessments are acceptable to concerned departments .  
Mrs Ng stressed that the conceptual development option had been measured against a comprehensive set of criteria , ranging from land-use planning , urban design , landscape , heritage , social and economic issues to cost , transport and environmental considerations .  
The Authority has also set key environmental management goals and targets for the coming years .  These include improving energy saving in new estates and the recovery rate of waste for recycling , increasing water recycling at construction sites , enhancing environmental design of residential buildings and adopting environmentally friendly building materials .  
During its stay in Ottawa and Toronto , the delegation will meet with parliament members and committees dealing with trade and commerce , environmental protection , health care , technology and international relations , as well as senior officials of the Canadian Government , representatives of major overseas Chinese social and business communities , and other non-Government organizations .  They will exchange views with each other on the latest political and economic developments in their regions .  
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; environment ; and topical studies .  
According to the findings of the EIA study , the potential impacts arising from the project on various aspects ( including impacts on water quality , air quality , noise , waste management , ecology , fisheries and cultural heritage as well as landscape and visual impacts ) can meet the established environmental objectives .  
Energy Ministers in previous meetings agreed that the application of economically sound measures to minimise the adverse environmental impacts of energy production and use was essential for protecting the well-being of both present and future generations .  
The full set of 1999 Hong Kong Definitive Stamps is beautifully arranged in an elegant wooden black frame and mounted on environmental friendly acid free paper to ensure its long-lasting appreciation value .  
As for other types of battery waste which are disposed of at the three landfills , they should not cause environmental problems since the landfills are lined with impermeable liners to prevent underground leakage of contaminated liquid , and such liquid is properly collected and treated within the landfills .  
This enables MTRCL to commence work on the Project before the grant of the franchise , including developing a sufficient design for the System and its ancillary developments , carrying out requisite environmental and technical studies , and completing the necessary statutory procedures .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
" With the promotion of various precautionary measures against AP by the Department of Health over the past few weeks , we believe that members of the public are all on high alert to guard against the disease .  We are now aware that washing hands frequently , building up good body immunity , wearing facemasks and paying heed to environmental hygiene are effective means to prevent AP . "  
During the weekend we will clean up a great variety of venues , ranging from public housing , private housing , environmental hygiene black spots , to social , educational institutions and commercial premises , as well as engaging all sectors of the community .  The places that will be cleaned up include : ( a ) Multi-storey buildings  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; the environment ; and topical studies .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon YEUNG Yiu-chung , says : " That this Council urges the Government to expeditiously draw up a set of cross-sector and sustainable framework and strategies to reorganize and enhance the environmental hygiene improvement measures of the relevant government bureaux and departments , and to pool the efforts of various sectors of the community , including the business and education sectors , professional bodies , District Councils and non-government organizations , to mobilize the participation of all citizens to ensure that Hong Kong becomes a clean and hygienic metropolis . "  
Last week , the " Team Clean " headed by the Chief Secretary for Administration announced a wide range of firm and decisive measures to promote good personal and public hygiene , tackle the environmental hygiene black spots , and give Hong Kong a complete face-lift .  
( iii ) The " Team Clean " headed by the Chief Secretary for Administration announced last week , as Phase I of the team 's work , a wide range of firm and decisive measures to promote good personal and public hygiene and tackle the environmental hygiene black spots .  These measures will produce quick and visible improvements in our living environment .  
Six illegal cooked food hawking black spots in PHEs were identified under the Government 's Team Clean initiatives in improving territory-wide environmental hygiene .  A total of about 200 joint operations were carried out in these estates including Tai Wo Hau , Lei Muk Shue , Shek Lei ( I ) , Lower Wong Tai Sin ( II ) , Wah Fu and Lok Wah ( North ) .  
It has been agreed that existing expert groups and new groups established under the Sixth Plenary will be consolidated into 15 groups .  They will undertake studies , follow up and implement various co-operation items endorsed at the Joint Conference . They will also continue to take forward other co-operation items , including Tonggu Waterway , co-operation in sustainable development and environmental protection , information exchanges , and co-operation in culture and sports .  
Both sides will actively take forward the major cross-boundary infrastructural projects .  Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macao have decided to set up a Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Advance Work Coordination Group ( Coordination Group ) .  Hong Kong will be the convenor of the Coordination Group , and Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macau will each appoint three representatives as members of the Coordination Group to coordinate and take forward the advance work for the construction of the Bridge , including studies on economic benefits , alignment , environmental protection and hydrology .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
He told the Executive Yuan that large-scale investment and planning should be effected to make the region a protected area . In 1981 , the Home Administration invited experts in park and environmental planning to assist in organization of the national park scheme . The team spent one year investigating the plant and animal life in the area , as well as the geology , climate and natural ecology of the entire peninsula .  
People must be educated to appreciate the importance of environmental protection , Shih Meng-hsuing stressed , if the ideals of the national park concept are to be realized . People in Taiwan , he explained , lack concern for preservation of natural resources ; both tourists and local residents indiscriminately pocket shells and coral and carry off rare plant and animal life . The thoughtless littering of park and beach areas is also a serious problem which could lead to serious damage , especially to those more sensitive areas like the fragile coral reefs .  
Since we are still a middle-income nation , we must continue to develop our economy , yet at the same time , the affect of our dense population and the concentrated development of industry makes environmental questions extremely worthy of attention . Thus , our present policy is for economic growth and environmental protection to be simultaneously planned and considered and to be developed in balance .  
The premier stated that the Taiwan region has a prosperous society and a well-to-do way of life , but that owing to rapid economic growth , the increase of the population , and the swift spread of urbanization , the environmental protection measures and the related public infrastructure of the area have been hard put to remain adequate to the needs of the times .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
We must increase our investment in education in response to the long-term needs of our national development , and to realize the ideal of lifetime education . We must harmonize labor-management relations to ensure the smooth development of production . We must strengthen environmental protection . We must establish a social security system to assist the aged , debilitated , handicapped , and ill .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
If we look at it from a planning point of view , today 's social disorder shows the shortcomings of the government 's planned investments in social affairs . In the past economic growth was stressed , environmental protection deemphasized ; the environmental protection movement is the inevitable price to be paid . Everyone must acknowledge this , only then can the truth be understood .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services . This has caused the island 's medical standards to be , like its geographic location , quite distant from Taiwan .  
Japan 's environmental movement has been joined by doctors , lawyers and experts in various fields who have helped to set up research and legal channels to follow and even to educate the local populace in environmental issues enabling disputes to be resolved within the system and at the same time raising environmental awareness . "  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
In particular , though there are now many large corporations , many of these were built up from scratch by hard-working and frugal entrepreneurs . It would just be too painful for them to lay out the large amount of cash required to bring in an environmental engineering firm to install a full set of equipment .  
Today geologists are also worried that additional extraneous factors of environmental change , such as the possible melting of glacial ice due to the greenhouse effect , leading to a worldwide rise in sea levels , may further exacerbate the problem , causing land to sink into the sea even faster .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
Later , several women from Awakening branched off to form their own practical support groups , such as the Taipei Women 's Rescue Foundation , which mainly offers assistance to underage prostitutes , and the Homemakers ' Union and Foundation , which emphasizes environmental education . In addition , several " friendly peripheral associations " dealing with child prostitution , the rights of women workers , and so on , were also formed , thus gradually creating an intricate network .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
The reason there is still such a dazzling array of species on Earth today , with all the " natural wonders " they display , is because since life took its first steps , animals have shown a resilient capacity to face the challenges of all kinds of environmental pressures , by every imaginable means . Although the process has been a bloody one in which many species have bowed out into history , new species have continuously stepped forward onto the stage .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Liu Ming-lung , secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Education Foundation , notes that wet paddy field has a number of useful environmental functions , including stabilizing flow volume in rivers , absorbing excess in times of heavy rains and floods , improving water quality , reducing soil erosion , and improving air quality .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
As environmental standards have risen , the Basel Convention has been repeatedly amended . It lists over 50 types of hazardous waste for which cross-border movements are controlled , and by coordination with the World Customs Organization , new tariff schedule codes have been defined to more effectively control international movements of hazardous waste .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
In this issue are stories on the latest trends and options for graduate study , the changing structure of Taiwan 's population , the impact of environmental hormones , the community regeneration movement in aboriginal villages in eastern Taiwan , the legendary master of glove puppetry Huang Hai-tai , the beginning of efforts to stage Nobel Prize laureate Gao Xingjian 's Snow in August , and celebrities such as Angie Chai and Chien Wen-hsiu . Kick back , relax and read , and get a better understanding of our society , our home .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc . In no time at all the referendum seems to have become the convenient new favorite for solving deadlocked disputes .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Compound Eyes examines the question of environmental ethics , and tells a riveting ecological tale that juxtaposes the huge and the miniscule , the distant and the near , the perfect and the flawed .  
Immunity seesaw Although allergies are caused by physiological factors , adverse environmental factors can make an allergy much worse . Chiang Bor-luen points out that nitric oxide , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , and other waste gases emitted by motor vehicles and factories can harm the respiratory tract and aggravate a preexisting allergy .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .  
Over a decade ago , Hsu Jen-hsiu founded an environmentalist group and funneled his passion for exploration into disseminating environmental concepts . Lin A-min said farewell to the mountains in order to work . He says that life in Taipei seems even more like an exploration , packed with all kinds of curious spectacles and personalities . And last year Max Liu , whom nearly all of Taiwan 's explorers hold in the highest regard , departed this life and continued his exploration of the unknown in the mysterious world beyond .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
Typhoon Herb 's furious assault on central Taiwan in 1996 provoked waves of criticism of the overexploitation of hillside land areas . In view of social trends and the impact of Taiwan 's future accession to the WTO , it was decided that the NTU farm would switch to eco-experience tours and environmental education : thus was born the " Meifeng Eco-Experience Camp . "  
of course , sino japanese relations are not confined to economic cooperation and trade the two sides share identical views on major international issues with the deepening of mutual understanding , the two countries will surely make further progress in their cooperation in the areas of politics , culture and environmental protection  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
It attributed this alarming decline to a rapid population growth , uneven and poor rainfall patterns , environmental degradation , civil conflicts , an unfavorable international economic environment and inappropriate domestic policies  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
the standing committee also amended and improved the following : " civil procedural law ( for trial use ) , " " land use law , " " law on chinese foreign equity joint venture , " " law on environmental protection , " " patent law , " and " trade mark law "  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
The root causes of population movements and refugee flows continued to be both natural and man-made , with combinations of political , military , economic , climatic and environmental factors varying from situation to situation .  
It is widely recognized today that the concept of development has acquired a multidimensional character encompassing not only economic growth , but also political , social and environmental aspects .  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Activities of particular concern included the improper disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes , wilful pollution of the environment , negligent or reckless serious environmental damage , and trafficking in endangered species .  
These core offences , which could be autonomous and independent of environmental regulatory laws , should include deliberate , reckless or negligent assaults on the environment that cause or create imminent risks of serious damage , harm or injury .  
Today , spurred by concern over the potential for global warming and acid precipitation , coal is often criticized as a major source of environmental degradation at the local , regional and global levels .  
Political , regulatory , investment , fiscal , environmental and monetary issues have emerged as significant in encouraging direct foreign investment in mineral exploration .  
Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
The Bank 's policy in regard to lending outside the European Union has been based on detailed economic and technical analysis of alternative solutions and the optimum size and timing of project implementation , together with their environmental impact .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
In the past , environmental costs were measured largely in terms of the expense involved in remedial treatment of degraded water quality , investment in environmental control technologies , or compensation for damage caused to local farm land by toxic dust .  
The norm in environmental regulation is that Governments set maximum permissible discharge levels or minimum levels of acceptable environmental quality .  
Among the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual life styles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .  
With reductions in international and regional tensions , and with the growing recognition of global economic and environmental interdependence , the opportunity to mobilize human and financial resources for global problemsolving has never been greater .  
The complementarity of those national population reports to others commissioned by recent international conferences and initiatives relating to economic , environmental , social and related activities is noteworthy and encouraging .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .  
Activities in the area of sustainable environmental futures focus on the complex interactions of physical and human activities in changing the environment , especially in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world , and the effects upon sustainability .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
National access to information on international economic , demographic , social and environmental conditions is essential not only to informed decisionmaking , but also to competitive and effective participation in international markets .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
A provisional network of national focal points has also been established , representing all global regions and serving as a base on which to build the international response capacity to environmental emergencies .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
The Commission also regards the achievement of a safe and healthy environment , through strong and effective international and domestic environmental protection efforts , as an essential component of sustainable development .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
While national Governments were primarily responsible for implementing Agenda 21 and other environmental instruments the developing countries lacked the financial resources and technology to do so without continued and enhanced international cooperation .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
The Agency 's health-care programme continued to provide comprehensive primary care , including preventive and curative medical care , maternal and child health services , family-planning services and projects to improve environmental health , in addition to secondary care in the form of hospitalization and other referral and support services .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
In its proposed work programme for 1996-1997 , UNEP planned to support the work of the Centre in improving the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people .  Finally , the Executive Director assured the Commission that she would carry out all the extra tasks that would arise out of Habitat II .  
The deliberate creation of regional trading blocs , the introduction of managed trade and the attempts to link human rights , environmental considerations and labour codes to trade are major threats which , if implemented , would dim the hope of a free environment for trade .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
Unfortunately , Ukraine does not have the potential to cover on its own the substantial expenses required to solve the set of social , economic and environmental problems connected with eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
At the same time , the legal regime develops apace , as experts learn simultaneously to apply multiple sets of norms from such diverse areas as commercial law , civil law , environmental law , international economic law , the law of the sea , public and private international law and mining law .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .

Strengthening participation of youth in the protection ,  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Strengthen the capacities of their local governing bodies to deal more effectively with the broad range of developmental and environmental challenges associated with rapid and sound urban growth through comprehensive approaches to planning that recognize the individual needs of cities and are based on ecologically sound urban design practices ;  
Improving the use of data and information at all stages of planning and management , making systematic and simultaneous use of social , economic , developmental , ecological and environmental data ; analysis should stress interactions and synergisms ; a broad range of analytical methods should be encouraged so as to provide various points of view ;  
Strengthen information , systematic observation and assessment systems for environmental , economic and social data related to land resources at the global , regional , national and local levels and for land capability and land-use and management patterns ;  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
Countries are encouraged to set up national advisory environmental education coordinating bodies or round tables representative of various environmental , developmental , educational , gender and other interests , including non-governmental organizations , to encourage partnerships , help mobilize resources , and provide a source of information and focal point for international ties .  
Countries , assisted by international organizations , non-governmental organizations and other sectors , could strengthen or establish national or regional centres of excellence in interdisciplinary research and education in environmental and developmental sciences , law and the management of specific environmental problems .  
At national and provincial levels , water supply and environmental sanitation policies will be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization , while at the county level , programmes will be implemented to increase access to adequate quantities of water , improved latrine construction and hygiene education .  
In the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual lifestyles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
During a period of 60 years , the district 's population increased fivefold , and average output per unit of land rose almost tenfold , while environmental conditions measurably improved largely through the autonomous undertaking of erosion control measures by the farmers themselves .  
Within the changing context of sustainable development , developmental efforts should be able to pay its full costs , that is , the environmental and social costs ; for this reason resources have to be priced at or equal to the marginal value or scarcity rent and incorporated into development-related decision-making .  
The environmental problems have been aggravated by agricultural policies - which have encouraged increasing production of some commodities on fragile lands and the use of inappropriate farm practices - and the lack of markets to value environmental public goods or the failures of some markets to internalize environmental costs and benefits within farmers ' decision-making .  
Initiatives include increased research in the understanding of processes involved in climate , its variability , drought occurrence and desertification ; a new interactive database for use by local people and decision makers ; a new experimental network data project on river flow regimes in parts of Africa ; and the development of national environmental information systems .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
It decided to transmit to the Economic and Social Council a draft resolution on the contribution of comprehensive national policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems ( draft decision III ) .  
Today these plantations and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of silvicultural interventions , overmaturation and inadequate control of excessive wildlife populations ( which , in addition to being a generally uneconomical activity , is not appreciated by the general public ) , and new environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate changes .  
The international debate is increasingly concerned with how to reconcile national development objectives with such global environmental objectives as ameliorating climate change or conserving genetic pools to a degree that is often well beyond the needs of individual nation States .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
Future decision-makers must be trained to take an interdisciplinary approach that spans the environmental , social , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological advance .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
This is based on the need to train future decision-makers to take an interdisciplinary approach to the promotion of technology by evaluating the environmental , sociological , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological innovation and implementation .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
One representative , while questioning the ability of the draft articles to provide adequate environmental protection for international watercourses , wondered in particular whether the emphasis on optimal utilization did not overshadow the objective of leaving a watercourse in a pristine state .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
Several participants called for an increased role for UNEP 's regional offices on trade-environment issues , for greater emphasis on raising environmental understanding , awareness-building and education , and for technical analysis in such areas as prior informed consent , environmental reviews of trade policy , environmental dispute avoidance , analysis of intellectual property rights in technology transfer and international cooperation .  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
Recommendation 1 , Catalytic role of UNEP in emerging environmental issues : UNDP should , in its catalytic role in emerging environmental issues , draw to a greater extent on the contributions of the United Nations system and of the international scientific and other professional communities , to ensure that problems of wide international significance receive appropriate and adequate consideration by Governments , through the Governing Council and other bodies .  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
By its decision 16 / 25 of 31 May 1991 , the Governing Council set the following long-term goals for the work of ELI / PAC : ( a ) a coherent body of international law in the environmental field ; ( b ) national environmental laws adopted and institutions established in developing countries ; and ( c ) an operational comprehensive database on national and international environmental law . 
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
The granting of assistance is limited to the following conditions : ( a ) it should be selective and restricted to those parts of the economy where severe difficulties would otherwise occur ; ( b ) it should be limited to well-defined transitional periods laid down in advance and adapted to the specific socio-economic problems associated with the implementation of a country 's environmental programme ; and ( c ) it should not create significant distortions in international trade and investment .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
In this regard , the Commission may address the insufficient political acceptability of economic instruments ; difficulties in the design of economic instruments ; administrative difficulties with economic instruments ; conflicts between environmental and other policy objectives ; anxiety about repercussions on the international competitiveness of the national economy ; and adverse economic and structural conditions that the application of economic instruments may encounter .  
Aware of the need to recognize the importance of an understanding of gender issues within all areas of agricultural , social , economic , environmental and political life in order to achieve a balanced division of roles and responsibilities and an equitable access to resources and to the benefits of development ,  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations . 
To encourage Governments , relevant international organizations and the private sector to undertake further work with regard to the application of economic instruments , including tax reforms and the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in accordance with the conditions , needs and priorities of each country and giving full consideration to their potential environmental , economic and social impacts .  
To provide leadership in undertaking joint studies to develop further proposals to promote cooperation ( keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities ) in the implementation of nationally determined policy reforms through some form of voluntary consultative process that is flexible , and would proceed in stages and address the sectors and policies that offer the most promising opportunities for environmental , social and economic gains ;  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Governments have a responsibility to provide the necessary enabling environment , guiding markets and investments so that they operate in a manner compatible with national economic , social and environmental objectives and international trade arrangements and facilitate sustainable development .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
In decision 1993 / 239 , the Economic and Social Council took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , 1 / and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
The Economic and Social Council , in decision 1993 / 239 , took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Since 1959 , the scope and importance of space applications have expanded from a narrow field of science and technology to a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications , weather forecasting , resource management , prevention and mitigation of disaster , environmental monitoring and other social and economic activities in virtually every country .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
The subprogramme , in collaboration with United Nations organizations and international and national research institutions , aims at promoting the further development and application integrated environmental and economic analysis instruments , as well as national , regional and international programmes and policies for sound environmental management and sustainable development .  
ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
It was noted that industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required the adoption of measures to create an environment conducive to private investment ; ( i ) The importance of reversing environmental degradation and addressing its negative implications for long-term development was stressed .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
Research on " Caspian , Aral and Dead Sea Water Crisis and Perspectives " has been aimed at providing a comprehensive and objective environmental management setting for sustainable development , taking into account international political considerations and conflict resolution .  State-of-the-art research papers for the Forum have been commissioned , and a long-term field research programme is being designed as a part of the present project .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :  
Sixteen recurrent publications .  ( i ) Air pollution ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) national environmental performance reviews ( 6 ) ; ( iii ) environmental series ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) water series ( 2 ) ; and ( v ) revisions to the industrial accidents manual ( 4 ) ;  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
A provision of $ 58,100 would be required to hire consultants ( $ 24,700 ) to provide specialized inputs for documents related to regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of environmental policies and changing production patterns in the housing and urban infrastructure construction sector , including proposals for its modernization , and ( $ 33,400 ) for the convening of three ad hoc expert group meetings .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
In support of efforts to advance and incorporate environmental concerns at the earliest possible stages of economic decision-making , as recommended by Agenda 21 , support has been provided to a network of southern NGOs and development practitioners to build their capacity and collaboration capability in communications and research activities aimed at clarifying key policy issues before the Commission on Sustainable Development ( CSD ) .  
Special attention is drawn to the need for improved delivery of information to decision makers and to increased participation in environmental observations at the local and national levels within regional and international frameworks .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
It is easy to understand , in view of the difficulties of the alternative assessment methods discussed above , the aforementioned trend in international practice to limit reparation of environmental damage to the payment of costs of restoration , the replacement or damaged or destroyed resources or the introduction of equivalent resources where the court deems this to be reasonable .  
The Commission notes with concern that the growing recognition of the need to address patterns of production and consumption has not yet been matched by a full understanding of the implications of such patterns on economic , social and environmental conditions at the local , national and global levels .  
The Commission emphasizes that strengthened international cooperation in harmonizing criteria for the setting of voluntary product standards , with due regard to the specific environmental , social and economic conditions in developing producer / exporting countries , should take into account concerns about market access and the competitiveness of products and services .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
Delegations supported the broad goals of these recommendations , which were for UNEP to ( i ) reinforce its catalytic role , ( ii ) enhance its environmental coordinating activities within the United Nations system ; and ( iii ) facilitate its capacity to address emerging environmental issues .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
Specific reimbursement rates for environmental and intensified operational use conditions would be recommended by the initial United Nations technical survey team for approval within the mission budget and revised as required by changing circumstances .  
Consequently , re-emphasis on social infrastructure , and on " social capital " 1 / is now seen as indispensable for avoiding the pervasive cycle of economic decline , increasing poverty and environmental degradation from which many countries are now struggling to escape .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Review existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
This cooperation may contribute to the international establishment of an accessible joint implementation regime that is sensitive to environmental , developmental , social and economic priorities .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
The International Council of Environmental Law stated that , in partnership with the Environmental Law Centre of IUCN , it maintained what was probably the world 's most extensive collection of documents on environmental law and policy ( international treaties , supranational instruments , national legislation , soft law , literature and documents of international organizations , especially the United Nations system ) .  
The establishment of open relations and transparent cooperation among the States in the region in all areas , such as economy , trade , transport , telecommunications , environmental protection and other areas of common interest for independent and versatile development of the States and of the region as a whole based on the openness of the region to all neighbouring regions in order to ensure unimpeded flow of people , goods and capital ;  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
This composite picture of economic hardship compounded by environmental devastation , and of social strife compounded by economic hardship , has drawn only limited sympathy from the international community .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .

The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
62 The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive , synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .

Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
The representative of the United States of America said that at the Conferences held at Rio de Janeiro , Vienna , Cairo , Copenhagen and Beijing , Member States had been developing a blueprint for economic , social and environmental action that recognized the important linkages among the various issues considered .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .  
He supported international action on the management of chemicals , including persistent organic pollutants that took account of regional variations in environmental conditions and requirements .  The goal of sustainable development would best be met by an approach that considered the interests of all members of the international community .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .

Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on the urban transport , communications and energy sectors , and particular attention should be devoted to environmental policies and programmes in the developing countries with a view to improving and developing sustainable transport and communications systems , bearing in mind the respective social , economic and environmental requirements of those countries .  
His delegation believed that the international community should take strong and concerted action against terrorist groups which focused on economic targets with the potential to create environmental hazards , since such environmental damage could have global repercussions .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .

Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
downward trend recorded over the last three budgets and the absence of links between financial commitments and programming had aroused concerns and led to questioning as to whether environmental concerns had been recognized as having equal importance with social and economic concerns .  The Governing Council had again called on all Governments to contribute voluntarily to the Environment Fund in time to permit implementation of the planned activities .  
could also ensure the proper implementation of existing international environmental agreements , which their countries often rushed to sign without adopting the required enabling legislation .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
We propose that at its scheduled December 1996 meeting , the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl specify the phases and modalities for advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes in order to ensure the sustainable economic and social development of Belarus and other most severely affected countries in transition , which find themselves in a critical situation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
Within the framework of its inputs to ongoing and planned global environmental programmes such as GTOS , FAO will continue its cooperation with organizations within the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other international organizations by providing remote sensing expertise and by participating in pilot studies in areas within its mandate . 
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
She reaffirmed that the United States understood the term " sustained economic growth " as referring to " growth in the context of sustainable development " , consistent with paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development , which read as follows : " We are convinced that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
A particular weakness relates to understanding the interlinkages between economic activities and their social and environmental impacts , which can be distant in space and time ( though the knowledge base concerning the relationship between human activities and climate change has improved significantly in recent years ( see the report of the Secretary-General on chapter 9 of Agenda 21 ( Protection of the atmosphere ) ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 2 ) ) ) .  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
Promote the active participation of all stakeholders , including those in isolated and remote communities , in ensuring the integrated consideration of the environmental , social and economic objectives of rural development efforts ;  
There is a sense of great opportunity and hope that a new world can be built in which economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development can be realized through solidarity and cooperation within and between countries , and through effective partnerships at all levels .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Ensure that clean water is available and accessible to all human settlements by the year 2000 through , inter alia , the adoption and improvement of technology , and ensure that environmental protection and conservation plans are designed and implemented to restore polluted water systems and rebuild damaged watersheds ;  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
It was stated that the objectives of an emergency monitoring system were : ( a ) to provide national protection agencies and relevant research institutions with information to support strategic and emergency decisions ; ( b ) to re-establish the telecommunications and environmental data collection systems when an event had occurred in order to coordinate the local relief operations from the coordinating centre and to collect real-time environmental data ; and ( c ) to assess real-time and a posteriori damages , data that would be useful for understanding the phenomenon and its consequences .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
They reflect a recognition of the need to move away from the treatment of fields of international law ( relating , for example , to human rights , economic relations , environmental protection ) as being self-contained , towards the development of general rules of international law in which those separate fields retain their distinct character but are subject to an interconnected approach .  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
The Office has documented numerous case-studies worldwide of management and technical changes that have led to reduced environmental impacts and improved economic performance .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
The former involves the need to clarify and strengthen the relationship between existing international instruments or agreements in the field of environment and relevant social and economic agreements or instruments ; the latter , the aim of identifying and preventing , or resolving , where necessary , actual or potential conflicts , particularly between environmental and social / economic agreements or instruments , with a view to ensuring that such agreements or instruments are consistent .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
Improved access to private capital will be a key to success in providing EST opportunities for and improving the environmental performance of SMEs . Such companies have difficulties in remaining competitive in the rapidly expanding international marketplace .  
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
Conflicts have not been resolved by markets , and the water administration is to a large extent unable to address them ; ( g ) Water legislation should include water marketing principles , established within a balanced structure in which property protected water rights are accommodated to public interest , including the principle of effective and beneficial use and environmental protection .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The ongoing policy formulation with respect to mineral tenure development , investment codes , legal and fiscal frameworks , environmental management and social development is essential , along with the subsequent formalization through the legal system .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
Take note of the progress report , submitted by UNCTAD , of the analytical study on the relationship of environmental protection to international competitiveness , job creation and development , and invite UNCTAD to elaborate on the study , with the contributions of Governments , regional economic integration organizations , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and other relevant regional and international organizations , and to submit the results to the Commission at its fifth session , in 1997 .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
The main obstacle to the wide utilization of both energy efficiency measures and renewable sources of energy , including , solar , wind and tidal energy technologies , is the competitive advantage of fossil fuels , which is likely to prevail as long as their environmental costs are not internalized .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
First world environmental standards are becoming increasingly stringent and have moved from regulating obvious pollutants such as sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , to controlling , for example , the quality and quantity of industrial wastes , the transboundary shipment of hazardous wastes , acid mine drainage , and heavy metals releases .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group took note that concerning offshore oil and gas activities , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) had concluded that harmonized environmental regulations had been and were being developed in specific regional programmes , and such discussions were proving productive .  
Undertake research that is specific to women in a number of health areas , for example reproductive health ( including contraceptive research and development ) , as well as research on substance abuse , occupational health , environmental health , adolescent health , tuberculosis and tropical diseases , including any gender-specific determinants , disease patterns and consequences , with a view to making recommendations on health policy and programme improvements designed to ensure optimal health for men and women ( WHO , UNDCP ) .  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Noting that it is essential that strategies to move to sustainable consumption and production patterns of minerals be linked to strategies to maintain supply , and that the goal of ensuring optimal and efficient use of available resources with minimum environmental impact requires that the demand be met from the most efficient sources world wide ,  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
The ESCAP secretariat continued to monitor , review and analyse the economic and social development situation in the region and disseminated relevant information to policy makers and others to make possible better understanding of the macroeconomic policies conducive to sustained economic growth , poverty alleviation and the integration of environmental concerns into macroeconomic decision - and policy-making processes .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .  
In relation to " administering the resources of the Area " , in view of the interest of member States in conservation and rational management in the development of the resources of the Area , the Authority needs an effective and sustained effort to collect , manage and distribute information on the Area in order , inter alia , to provide an adequate understanding of the environmental impact likely to be caused by deep seabed mining , estimate the magnitude of the polymetallic nodule resources in the world 's oceans  
As to the specific proposal raised by Malta ( see A / 50 / 142 ) , the question of how the United Nations machinery for dealing with international environmental issues should be developed is a very important substantive issue that needs to be addressed in the first instance by the policy machinery that the General Assembly has set up to consider coordination of environmental and development issues - the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
Therefore , one can not find in the draft articles concepts such as water basin or integrated management . one can see sufficiently enshrined neither substantive principles such as sustainable development , precaution and preventive action nor their procedural corollaries : the requirement of environmental impact assessments , of transparency , of broadly informing and notifying the public and of consultation and negotiation on the impact of planned measures . 
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
After 10 years of assessment and monitoring of forest condition , knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of forest damage has grown considerably , and public awareness of air pollution as a threat to the environment and notably to forests has increased , providing an impetus for new national and international environmental policies and expanded research into forest damage .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
Cancelled : ( iii ) implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity ; ( iv ) one issue on regional implementation of the Convention on Desertification ; ( v ) sustainable development : methodologies , approaches and assessment ( 1996 ) ; ( vi ) ecological tourism development ; and ( xiii ) geology for land-use planning and environmental management .  
Postponed : ( i ) inventory of existing railway line standards and parameters ; ( ii ) inventory of existing combined transport standards and parameters ; ( iii ) inventory of existing road standards and parameters ; ( iv ) compendium on safe storage of cargo in containers ; ( vii ) European Code of Inland Waterways ; ( ix ) standardized vocabulary for inland navigation ; ( xi ) environmental performance of road vehicles ; and ( xv ) glossary for transport statistics ) ;  
Cancelled : ( iv ) regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of international and regional environmental policies ; and ( v ) evolution of the process of technology transfer for sustainable development .  
This strategy outlines Panama 's policy on maritime matters , with regard to its legal , scientific , economic and environmental aspects , and indicates the principles and purposes that guide the Panamanian State in its efforts to integrate itself in regional and international maritime activities in accordance with domestic legislation and international law .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
The GEF provides new and additional grants and funding to meet the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits in four focal areas : ( a ) the protection of biological diversity , ( b ) the reduction of greenhouse gases , ( c ) the protection of international waters , and ( d ) the protection of the ozone layer .  
His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club ; however , the approach must be broadened , bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments .  There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
The United Nations system had been a major actor in promoting a holistic approach to development - linking social , economic and environmental considerations - in all the developing countries , as evidenced by the organization and outcome of a number of international conferences , especially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the International Conference on Population and Development , the World Summit for Social Development , and the Fourth World Conference on Women . 
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
The Polessk State Radiation and Environmental Reserve , located in Belarus on territory directly adjacent to the Chernobyl nuclear power station , possesses appropriate infrastructure , including highly qualified scientists and experts , and has unique conditions and research subjects , thus making it possible to develop practical approaches and establish effective methods of overcoming the consequences of nuclear disasters and ensuring environmental rehabilitation of territories polluted by radionuclides . 
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
It therefore welcomed the set of measures outlined in subprogramme 5.4 ( Sustainable development ) which was intended to develop a comprehensive framework for the more effective integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development embracing the relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral components of Agenda 21 and incorporating the results of other major United Nations conferences held in recent years .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;

The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The milestones reported were the following : ( a ) Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) : the enhancement of the capability to generate reliable and timely environmental statistics and indicators ; ( b ) Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) : the development and strengthening of the national capabilities of the statistical offices in the region so that the regular and systematic collection of a minimum set of environmental statistics and indicators for a selected group of countries in the region could be achieved ;  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,

" Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The environmental policy sought to reconcile economic development with natural resource conservation and to make the high quality of the environment a key element in supporting the country 's economic and social development .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , including : consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy-saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce firewood collection ; and controlled firewood harvesting .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
Today it is universally accepted that sustainable development could be attained if it were approached in a comprehensive manner , and that sustained economic growth is closely linked with social development and environmental protection .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
At a time when the international community is struggling to deal with the problems of environmental degradation resulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel , the Agency 's achievements in the area of nuclear safety underline the merits of nuclear energy as the most feasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Five years have elapsed since we signed the historic Rio Declaration and agreed to a series of commitments , contained in Agenda 21 , on economic , social and environmental development .  
It will be composed of 29 members , of whom 14 will be drawn from the Government 10 of them ministers and 15 from the business , labour and academic spheres ; local authorities ; non-governmental organizations from the economic , social and environmental spheres ; congressional representatives ; and three independent members .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
The effectiveness of waste - management policies may be enhanced when combined with economic and environmental policies designed to improve , for example , efficiency in production and consumption and with policies targeted at making production processes and consumer choice and behaviour more suitable .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
To address the issue of the lack of the critical long-term data necessary to understand global environmental problems , international organizations and the scientific community have designed observing systems to make data collection more coherent and cost-effective .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
Some of those concerns were raised in an input made by the Non-Governmental Organizations Caucus on Transnational Corporations , composed of 27 non-governmental organizations with a wide membership around the world , focusing on the growing dependence on voluntary corporate environmental practices at the expense of the diminishing role of Governments in overseeing and monitoring corporate responsibility .  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
Human rights violations have been reported , in addition to sporadic and discretionary enforcement of environmental regulations : reportedly , unlined toxic waste pits allow pollution to seep into drinking water supplies , thus threatening the right to health of surrounding communities , and calls for compensation from the oil companies are often met with claims of sabotage or payment of compensation to the Government of which the local villagers see little . 
The company is also held responsible for environmental damage ranging from devastating a protected forest , to polluting a river , to damaging bridges and roads that local people use to transport their products to market . 
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
The precautionary approach is widely accepted as a fundamental concept of national environmental laws and regulations in order to protect the environment . 76 It is elaborated , for instance , in the Water Law and Planning Law of Israel , 77 in the Environmental Protection Act of the Czech Republic , 54 and is included in numerous draft environmental laws currently under consideration - for example in the Pakistan draft environmental protection act of 1996 . 
In Gambia , for example , the 1994 Act on Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides Control and Management contains a provision that international notification schemes relating to chemicals and pesticides , including the prior informed consent procedures , are to be implemented . 94 Some other examples of national legal implementation of the principle of prior consultation are directly linked to regulations regarding environmental impact assessment procedures . 
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
R &amp; amp ; D involving ICTs is yielding applications in areas such as integrated resource management , coordinated medical centres , environmental research and land management , biodiversity monitoring , biochemical engineering and molecular medicine , solar water heating and other energy conservation applications , and laboratory-based testing and standardization .  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Progress in the post-UNCED debate was attested by : the increased focus on exploring the scope of complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection ; the greater degree of confidence built up between the environmental and trade communities ; a balanced and integrated approach to the trade and environment agenda encouraged by the international community ; and , the work programmes of UNCTAD , WTO and UNEP which , together with the Commission on Sustainable Development , had clearly anchored the objectives of sustainable development and the trade and environment theme .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Comparisons of the two types of solutions considered at the preliminary pilot project stage provided ample confirmation that the " tunnel " option was more realistic and advantageous , from the technical , economic and environmental standpoint , than the " bridge " option .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the Pacific island developing countries related to their isolation , small size and vulnerability to environmental hazards have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and other international declarations .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session , recognized that the " management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests are a crucial factor in economic and social development , in environmental protection and in the planet 's life-support system .  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among other things , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
An important outcome of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction was the recognition of the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21.2 More specifically , the Conference reaffirmed Principle 18 of the Rio Declaration , 3 which stressed the need for the international community to assist States afflicted by natural disasters and other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects to the environment . 
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
The activities included the enhancement of statistical methodologies , which were vital in evaluating the Institutes programmes and projects ; the preparation of a multi-media modular package on women , environmental management and sustainable development , in cooperation with the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization in Turin ; and the drafting , currently in progress , of a manual to assist womens organizations in maximizing the use of computer-mediated communication technologies in all their activities .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
After extensive work involving inspections , analysis of large volumes of documentation and of information received from Member States and former suppliers of relevant items , the use of new techniques for environmental monitoring , questioning of Iraqi staff and examination of items recovered from excavations , we have been able to construct a technically coherent picture of Iraq 's past nuclear programme and to gain a good understanding of the scope of the achievements of the programme .  
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .  
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
Israel reported that at the criminal supervisory level , a well-equipped and highly mobile " environmental patrol " , staffed by trained personnel authorized with police officers ' powers , operated within the Ministry of the Environment .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
First , while the earlier debate was characterized largely by fears of important contradictions between trade and environment policies , the post-UNCED debate has focused on exploring the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection , and has enlarged the development dimension in the discussion on most issues .  Conceptual and empirical analyses and debate have helped to set aside some of the early fears of incompatibility between trade and environment policies which could have induced inappropriate policy choices .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .  Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti 's long-term development , meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental , agricultural , educational and administrative reform programmes .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
The Guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , which include ; consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce fuelwood collection ; and controlled fuelwood harvesting .  
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
This includes improved contribution to the work of those bodies on the development and updating of a wide range of international legal instruments , regulations and recommendations that provide a common technical and legal basis for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks , for the improvement of the efficiency , safety and environmental performance of the transport sector and for the facilitation of border crossing .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Seven projects on modern techniques and technologies for the development of both surface and groundwater resources ; use of alternative sources of energy ; new and renewable energy technologies ; and improving the efficiency of resource use , minimizing waste and maximizing recycling and environmental protection ;  
Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;  
Although , in the Declaration adopted by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore , Ministers rejected the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and agreed that the comparative advantage of countries , particularly low-wage developing countries , must in no way be put into question , the continuing calls for higher labour , social and environmental standards are seen by many in developing countries as a way of promoting new and disguised forms of protectionism .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development2 - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
While it is true that appropriate technologies to limit environmental degradation and reverse the trend can easily be identified , the fact remains that the connection between environmental degradation and egotistically driven consumption which , though it serves as an impetus to economic growth , does not apportion properly the resulting benefits remains to be made , notwithstanding all the fine words to the contrary .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Thus , Cameroon , for its part , has worked to develop internal legal provisions and appropriate structures , including , in particular , a law on the forest and animal regime ; the institutionalization and organization of educational seminars on environmental problems ; the creation of a national advisory commission for environment and sustainable development ; and the development of a national plan of action for environmental management .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
It should be recalled that the alternative site given to the Jahalin is located on rocky and windy land 500 metres from the Jerusalem garbage dump and was declared by an Israeli environmental study to be unfit for human habitation .  
Only an efficient universal organization can help us cope with the pressing challenges of globalization , economic and social development , environmental changes and the urgent need to protect and respect human rights .  
On the eve of the new millennium , I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic , environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States .  
Transnational corporations now have greater freedom to set up in countries where , owing to political , economic or social constraints or a lack of human and financial resources , environmental legislation is rudimentary , non _ existent or poorly enforced .  
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
Thus , solidarity was the precondition for a lasting solution to all crises political , economic and environmental that threatened international peace and stability and undermined the chances for genuine and sustainable development for all .  
In developing a national legislation , it has been found convenient to first construct an umbrella or a framework environmental law which lays down the basic legal principles without attempting to codify all relevant statutory provisions .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
In the next century , the planet Earth faces the potential hazard of rapid environmental changes , including global warming , rising mean sea level , deforestation , desertification and land degradation , ozone depletion , acid rain and a reduction in biodiversity .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
Reaffirming the need to incorporate sustainable development strategies , since they are essential to achieving economic , social , and environmental goals in a balanced and complementary manner ,  
Twenty-one per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 22 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Principle 11 of the Rio Declaration stated that environmental standards applied by some countries might be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries , in particular developing countries .  
The devastating social , economic and environmental impact of anti-personnel mines and their detrimental effects on the creation of conditions conducive to sustainable development is well documented .  
In conclusion , he said that he wished to reiterate that UNEP needed a solid financial base in order to discharge its strengthened mandate and meet the growing environmental challenges worldwide .  
Other environmental health risks such as unsafe uses of lead , tobacco and ambient and indoor air pollution need to be adequately addressed in local , national and regional preventive strategies with a view to reducing their potential effects .  
UNCTAD has also concluded that it is not practical to prescribe a specific curriculum for general knowledge since this is a function of many different cultural , sociological and environmental factors , and should be decided at the national level .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
It is the task of the national statistical system to make available to government , the public and the private sector relevant and reliable statistical information for economic , social , cultural and environmental developments in a country ;  
It has encouraged extensive public participation , set up a mechanism of institutional guarantees , engaged extensively in international cooperation , and made notable progress in environmental protection as well as in economic and social development . 
Twenty per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 16 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
If there is no determined international concerted effort to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the poor , then we will have the classical scenario of poverty breeding environmental decay .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
Energy plays a key role in achieving the economic , social and environmental objective of sustainable development , and the supply of energy must be secure and reliable .  
Firmly convinced of the environmental , economic , social and cultural importance of all types of forests , Liechtenstein supports all efforts aimed at establishing an international , legally binding , comprehensive and coherent instrument on sustainable forest management .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
This Alliance represents a regional and national strategy whose basic principle is to bring about integral changes in Central American economic , social , cultural and environmental development , with every aspect geared towards respecting all forms of life , improving the quality of life , preserving and respecting the diversity of the planet and our region and respecting human rights and multiculturalism in our region .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
Since its establishment by the General Assembly in 1963 , it had advised United Nations bodies , the national institutions of Member States and non-governmental organizations through training programmes in a variety of disciplines ( multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management , peacemaking and preventive diplomacy , environmental law , migration policy and law , capacity-building in the field of economic and social development ) .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
Provision of technical advisory services to Member States , as well as international and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science , satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in these fields , upon request ( 8 to 10 per year ) .  
The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
Providing advisory services to sensitize Governments with regard to the need to incorporate in the Constitution , in framework environmental laws or in international environmental instruments , provisions on the individual 's right to a clean and healthy environment , access to justice and information - including prior informed consent procedures - public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters ;  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
As far as his country was concerned , the efforts to reduce poverty and ensure social peace had been based on the plans of action formulated at the major United Nations conferences , and were aimed at achieving a form of development which reconciled growth and environmental protection , while ensuring a decent minimum income and the exercise of basic human rights for all citizens .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
While continuing to provide regional comparable statistics and indicators needed for assessing and monitoring progress achieved in sustainable development in the ESCWA region , during the biennium 20002001 , the subprogramme will concentrate on upgrading these services to better respond to the renewed and growing interest in statistics and indicators covering a wide range of economic , social and , for the first time , environmental concerns associated with sustainable development .  
In collaboration with appropriate United Nations and external partners , the subprogramme will alert the world to emerging problems by initiating periodic assessments of priority environmental issues , strengthening linkages to global and national environmental observation programmes and helping to provide authoritative information for policy formulation and implementation . 
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assistance to Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels that address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Reflection and presentation of a timely , accurate , appropriate image of UNEP through systematic dissemination of targeted information on the environmental agenda and initiatives to enlist audience support through the media , and assistance in mobilizing adequate international response to major emerging environmental issues ;  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
During the biennium 20002001 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
Reasons for this unsustainable pattern of development in the ESCWA region include poor institutional arrangements , deficiency in environmental , economic and social information , a lack of public participation in the decision-making process , and severe inadequacy in institutional capacities and qualified human resources .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
While the operator was to be generally held liable for damage , a problem arose in respect of a provision imposing on the operator an obligation of reasonable compensation for unrepaired damage or irreparable harm or where response action was not possible , not feasible or , for environmental or other reasons , not desirable .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all . 
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
Satellites are today an essential tool for weather forecasting , direct television broadcasting , telecommunications , geographical positioning , air , sea and land traffic control , environmental protection and many other operations that are increasing in number and producing a broad economic and social impact .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Numerous international documents have been severely violated by the unprovoked and illegal NATO aggression : the Charter of the United Nations , the humanitarian law provisions , especially the Geneva Conventions with the related protocols , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , provisions of international agreement in the field of the environment , as well as the basic proclaimed principles of environmental protection .  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
Accord appropriate priority to inland water transport in policy , planning and investment based on detailed analysis of the economic , financial , social and environmental benefits , and to promote public awareness of such benefits , thereby encouraging a modal shift to inland water transport , where appropriate ;  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
Problems requiring special attention include : health effects , where there is a confirmed increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer , in particular , in those who were children at the time of the accident ; environmental problems , such as the reuse of contaminated forests , contaminated food and water pollution ; psychological impact on the population ; and social and economic rehabilitation of the affected areas .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Also notes the need to secure the participation of a diverse range of stakeholders drawn from government , non-governmental organizations , academia , centres of excellence , professional bodies and business enterprises in a partnership arrangement aimed at providing an integrated environmental information service at the national level , and encourages Governments to establish these partnerships under a formal agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme ;  
Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
During the two phases , it is very important to obtain sufficient information from the potential mining sites ( commonly termed " baseline data " ) to document clearly the natural conditions which exist prior to mining , and to gain insights into the natural processes such as dispersion and settling of particles , and benthic faunal succession , and to gather other data which will make it possible to acquire the necessary predictive capability for accurate environmental impact prediction .  
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Space environmental exploration and research has been carried out on energy electrons , protons , heavy ions and their single particle effects , radiation dosage effects , space thermal plasma , upper atmospheric density and components and solar energy electromagnetic radiation .  
If the distinction had become commonplace in international law at the doctrinal level , it would be worthwhile searching for further applications of the concept , for example , by considering areas such as the law of the sea , environmental law and diplomatic law .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
India considers that the integration of environmental and developmental concerns is essential for the fulfilment of basic needs and ensuring improved living standards for all , better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer and more prosperous future .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
My country attached the utmost importance to the Cairo Conference , both in its own right and as a part of a global strategy for the promotion of sustainable development , which takes into account the recognized linkages between population , environmental protection and economic and social development .  
The objectives of the Government in oil refining are : to increase lubrication oil production to meet overall local demand ; to improve the quality of refined products by reducing sulphur contents in gas oil and kerosene and the necessity for lead compounds in gasoline ; to improve safety standards and fire - fighting capabilities ; to improve environmental protection by enhanced treatment to effluent water and gas emissions ; and to increase operating efficiency in general .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The objective of the meeting was to formulate an environmental studies model to encourage cooperation among States , national scientific institutions , the registered pioneer investors and potential contractors in research on environmental predictions for deep seabed mining .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
He stressed in particular the need for prior consultation and full participation of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of energy projects , for compensation and benefit _ sharing , and for sociocultural impact studies to be integrated into the normal environmental impact assessments .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .  
The resulting Antigua Declaration , adopted on 11 March , recognizes the impact of Hurricane Mitch and , in supporting the reconstruction and transformation initiative , reaffirms shared values of democracy , the free market , respect for human rights and fundamental liberties , the rule of law , the struggle against international crime and a commitment to environmental protection .  
During the past year , the priorities of ALIDES have been advanced through a wide range of initiatives and meetings at various levels of government , encompassing the social sector , public finance and economic growth , environmental protection and sustainable development , and the strengthening of SICA and other regional institutions as a means of pursuing the goals of ALIDES .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,  
Alternative 1 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response [ to natural disasters as well as the need to contain ] [ aimed at containing ] environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Alternative 2 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms in order to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
It identified five areas of concentration : ( i ) environmental information , assessment and research , including environmental emergency response capacity and strengthening of early warning and assessment functions ; ( ii ) enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; ( iii ) fresh water ; ( iv ) technology transfer and industry ; and ( v ) support to Africa ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Provision of advisory services to 16 countries for the development of legislative proposals to implement selected environmental agreements that address identified environmental and sustainable development issues ( through national task forces , consultants , technical backstopping and national consensus-building forums ) ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
the implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements - such as the Montreal Protocol , the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( FCCC ) , the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) - in a manner consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as they are being concluded , signed and ratified , taking into account core environmental principles such as the precautionary principle ;  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
One of the fundamental principles of the Programme was that the formulation and implementation of population-related policies is the responsibility of each country and should take into account the economic , social and environmental diversity of conditions in each country , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of its people ( A / CONF . 171 / 13 , article 1.11 ) .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of national and local initiatives in Norway , a preparatory process to implement Agenda 21 in local communities was already under way and of a holistic , cross-sectoral approach that integrated environmental , economic and social concerns .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Endeavours are being made to achieve this goal through the programmes and activities of the primary health-care institutions ( primary health services , maternal care and family planning , immunization against contagious and endemic diseases , environmental health , promotion of healthy nutrition , provision of a safe water supply , health education , oral and dental hygiene and care of the aged ) . 
This is illustrated by the " healthy villages " project , a community-based project designed , sponsored and monitored by the Ministry of Health and adopted by the village community , with assistance from other public bodies , with a view to improving all aspects of village living conditions , particularly in the health , environmental , social and economic fields .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
In the field of operational activities , considerable progress had been made during the triennial policy review towards formalizing the view that human centred development included economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;

Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
The European Union attached great importance to the commitments made by all countries and major groups to the implementation of the principles of the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 ; it believed that the enhancement of public awareness was essential and engaged in continuous dialogue with civil society on environmental matters .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The orbital network of spacecraft operated by Russia was carrying out assignments in a range of basic areas , including implementation of international agreements , organization of manned orbital flights and operation of new industrial technology in space , conduct of basic scientific research , creation of global communications and television broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia , and also environmental monitoring and disaster management .  
Plays an active role in developing and facilitating consultations with Governments , including through permanent missions accredited to UNEP in Nairobi , leading to better understanding of Governments expectations and environmental needs , and keeps Governments informed of UNEPs ongoing activities and plans ;  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
They include activities such as environmental planning , use of the geographical information system ( GIS ) , the global positioning system ( GPS ) and satellite images in environmental assessment and monitoring , demarcation of protected areas , guided firewood harvesting , promotion of energy-efficient cooking devices and practices , erosion control , tree planting , agroforestry , and environmental education and awareness raising .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
It is also demonstrated by our vigorous efforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional wisdom of the past , which sacrificed environmental concerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic growth . 
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
We are fully convinced that the United Nations , as the most representative and democratic of international organizations , remains the international forum most qualified to deal with the effects of globalization in the economic , social and environmental areas , as well as with questions of equality and fairness between the sexes .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The Commission is therefore convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach is required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at intergovernmental and inter-agency levels .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
In addition , the design and development are lacking of a common strategy for energy-related activities in the system aimed at promoting a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and of fostering partnership for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
At both the national and international levels , it was essential that Governments and non-governmental organizations alike should fight for democracy and the elimination of poverty and social exclusion as matters of priority.They should also focus on guaranteeing other emerging rights of cardinal importance for future generations like environmental protection .  
The apparent economic and technical obsolescence of a major part of the fleet is necessarily reflected in higher operating costs , as repair and maintenance rapidly increase with age , schedule delays and unreliability , and greater environmental risks associated with obsolete vessels .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
Work at the national and international levels in recent years has focused on a number of promising strategies for changing consumption and production patterns , including internalizing environmental and social costs in market prices , removing subsidies for unsustainable production and consumption activities , and integrating environmental and social goals in economic policy-making .  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
By the early 1990 s , national tourism authorities had generally come to realize that the economic benefits of tourism would not be achievable in the long run unless tourism was properly planned and managed to include an explicit concern for the social and environmental assets upon which its future prosperity depended .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
In Mauritius , a national environmental commission has been set up , chaired by the Prime Minister , with a broad membership , including ministers responsible for economic planning , finance , education , science and technology , energy and natural resources , tourism , industry , health and justice , and representatives of local government .  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
The realization of the right to adequate food is inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , both at the national and international level , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant governmental agency conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
In spite of the constraints encountered , many small island developing States have established initiatives to balance tourism activities with broader economic , social and environmental objectives at the regional , national and local levels .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
Much of the effort thus far has centred on understanding the crucial role of sound environmental management for the sustainability of socio-economic development ; on coming to grips with the multitude of environmental issues calling for attention ; on raising public awareness of the importance of protecting environmental assets ; and on the exploration of strategies , policies and measures for integrating environmental dimensions into socio-economic planning and development practices .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In accordance with resolution 1998-46 , the Committee is to be composed of 24 independent experts , with expertise drawn from the fields of economic development , social development and environmental protection , and reflect adequate geographical and gender balance .  
Urban governance , which is defined by how well a population , its representatives and agents identify and deal with the major social , economic and environmental issues , is greatly improved when it is characterized by multi-stakeholder strategic planning , participatory management and the promotion of civic values .  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Promote , through educational and other programmes , efforts aimed at better informing the population about the urgent problems of environmental protection , rational nature management and improving the living environment for current and future generations.For the Republic of Kazakhstan : 
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;

Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
The topics of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law and of State responsibility were closely related to environmental protection , a subject which was being dealt with in various specialized bodies where solutions were tailored to specific environmental problems .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Likewise , new safety and environmental standards impose on building owners major obligations to retrofit existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , handicap access , interior air quality , asbestos abatement , shielding of electromagnetic fields , elimination of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) compounds , and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
Points of public concern include matters such as continuity in the provision of public services ; adherence to environmental protection , health , safety and quality standards set by the host country ; fairness of prices charged to the public ; non-discriminatory treatment of customers or users , full disclosure of information pertaining to the operation of infrastructure facilities and the flexibility needed to meet changed conditions , including expansion of the service to meet additional demand .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Distance learning instruction is supplemented by specialized inaugural or followup workshops held at the national or regional level along with selected intensive efforts for environmental law capacitybuilding at national level .  
The unique role of the community of nongovernmental organizations , at local , regional , national and international levels , in putting environmental issues on the agenda and promoting social innovation was recognized .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .  
Our common objective is to meet the ever increasing needs of human development in the economic and social spheres , while not simply preserving , but gradually restoring natural ecosystems to conditions that will guarantee environmental sustainability .  
The vast oceanic area under the control of our members is rich in fishing potential but requires careful management and monitoring to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing and other environmental threats .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
The fast pace of globalization , the competition for FDI and the sheer size of many transnational corporations ( TNCs ) can make it difficult for a host country acting alone to set in place adequate environmental controls over incoming FDI .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Tectonic and environmental hazard mapping of the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault system using a digital elevation model ( DEM ) from ESA remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) tandem mission synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data ( international ) ;  
Parallel to the understanding of the indivisible nature of human rights is an understanding of the integrated political , economic , social , cultural and environmental nature of development .  
Such a system must also include the principles of diversity and holistic and integrated development , based not only on economic but also on political , social , gender , cultural and environmental dimensions .  
This new framework is a holistic and integrated approach to development strategies and programs that highlights the interdependence of all aspects of development strategy : social , human , institutional , environmental , economic and financial .  
According to a recent white paper , the latter had moved all its dependent Territories from their former colonial status into a modern partnership status that extended to administrative , economic , social and environmental matters .  
It had also been recognized that the industrialized countries should take urgent measures , both corrective and preventive , to resolve pressing global environmental problems .  
Capacity 21 was another UNDP innovative initiative , which dated from 1993 and was aimed at facilitating the integration of economic , social and environmental considerations into national programmes for sustainable development .  
She also raised the legal , economic , social , human and environmental problems caused by the export of contaminated ships destined for scrap in developing countries .  
The new functional organizational structure , which was considered and endorsed by the special session of the Governing Council held in May 1998 , indicates that UNEP is addressing all environmental issues in a holistic and integrated manner .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
Thus , it should be stressed that sustainable participatory development would not , then , be fully achieved , as it remains conditional on political , economic and social , environmental and cultural sustainability .  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
The plan defined the legal , normative , organizational , economic , scientific , technical , environmental and social aspects of such cooperation as well as its main policies and tasks .

Stop imposing economic sanctions , which deprive people of their basic economic , social and environmental rights and which make their struggle for survival , as well as for civil and political rights , more difficult . 
The report demonstrates that coordinated implementation of the environmental conventions is essential at the local level , where it is possible to make a significant difference and where tangible benefits are not only easily achievable but also demonstrable .  
UNEP has also recognized that a strong regional architecture is central to its ability to manage and advance the larger global environmental agenda and has accordingly enhanced its regional presence .  
The meeting , attended by representatives of global and regional multilateral environmental conventions , identified potential areas for collaboration among those conventions on topics such as assessment , trade and streamlining of national reporting .  
It was essential that the Conference should be based on a global approach to development , that reflected not only basic economic aspects but also the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
While all States agreed that the environment must be protected and that potentially harmful activities must be regulated , environmental standards and national financial capacities varied and it would be difficult to establish a minimum standard of conduct .  
The focus should be placed on the social , economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development , as expressed in broad themes recognized as the main challenges before the international community .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
Economic , social and environmental linkages essential for achieving SHD have been widely acknowledged yet applied methodologies and practical tools to address these linkages are not fully reflected in macroeconomic reform processes and framework setting .  
The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , almost 15 years ago , affected almost the entire territory of Europe but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation and caused long-lasting , complex problems .  The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
By decision 21 / 21 , the Council decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental group of ministers or their representatives , with the Executive Director as an ex officio member , to undertake a comprehensive policy-oriented assessment of existing institutional weaknesses as well as future needs and options for strengthened international environmental governance , including the financing of UNEP , with a view to presenting a report containing analysis and options to the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum .  
Also concerned about the increasing number of emerging and crisis situations in the world , particularly in Africa as a result of global environmental changes with adverse social , cultural and economic effects ,  
Emphasizing that stable , predictable and adequate funding is a prerequisite for improved governance and should constitute a central aspect of deliberations on improving international environmental governance ,  
Recalling the recommendations from the Malm Ministerial Declaration 2 / that the 2002 World Summit should review the requirements for a greatly strengthened institutional structure for international environmental governance based on an assessment of future needs for an institutional architecture that has the capacity to effectively address wide-ranging environmental threats in a globalizing world , and that United Nations Environment Programmes role in this regard should be strengthened and its financial base broadened and made more predictable ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The political , economic , environmental , social , humanitarian , information and many other components of preventive activities are coming to the fore .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
Recommendations emanating from the Workshop are expected to focus on future needs for the regulation of space traffic , Earth-threatening asteroids and comets , global navigation satellite systems , space and the public and on the contribution of space systems to the implementation and verification of international environmental agreements .  
Unless resource management and development strategies based on space remote sensing and other information technology inputs consistent with societal demands and cultural practices were adopted on a worldwide scale , it would not be possible to ensure environmental security in the coming decades . 
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1998 / 46 , the Committee is composed of 24 independent experts with expertise drawn from the fields of economic development , social development and environmental protection and who reflect adequate geographical and gender balance .  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Services cover maternal care / reproductive health , child health , curative care , dental health , health education / promotion , control of communicable diseases , prevention and control of non-communicable chronic diseases through the promotion of healthy lifestyles , and environmental health services .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
The Commission also encouraged Governments to take into consideration the health and safety concerns of women and children in rural energy programmes , and to promote efforts to address the disproportionate burdens experienced by women in rural areas in access to energy supply .  Governments were encouraged to improve policies that reduce environmental health hazards , including through plans and strategies to prevent , mitigate and respond to diseases resulting from indoor and outdoor air pollution , giving special attention to the health of women and children .  
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
The UNDP Environment Policy Adviser and the Procurement Adviser have developed basic environmental guidelines , an overview of the key issues involved , sources of detailed and reliable information and generic recommendations on major procurement items for use by the Advisory Committee on Procurement and country offices .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
Slovakia fully supported the continuation of UNIDOs successful transformation in order to increase the impact , relevance and usefulness of the Organization in its task of promoting responsible and sustainable industrial development , as a means of achieving economic well-being and social development while ensuring environmental sustainability .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
In many cities , confronted with rapid growth , environmental problems and the slow pace of economic development , it has not been possible to generate sufficient employment , provide adequate housing and meet the basic needs of the citizens .  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
The indigenous knowledge of rural women and their experience in subsistence production and environmental management should be recognized by national and local governments and development experts as a resource , and should be integrated into formal programmes .  
The Ministry calls upon all concerned countries and specialized international organizations to strictly adhere to the legal regime and the constitution of Georgia , which stipulate that the Georgian supreme bodies have the exclusive right to administer a system of environmental protection , as well as legislation on land , minerals and natural resources for the whole territory of Georgia .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
The incumbent will be responsible for construction and building management in field missions and will manage a broad range of projects and contracts ranging from rental of premises , vertical / horizontal construction , sanitary and environmental projects , power supply systems , water storage , distribution and treatment systems , field defences and combat engineering activities .  
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
Express our deep conviction that religious , moral and ethical values can play a major role in addressing the global as well as the local environmental challenges facing humanity ;  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
After surveying Member States to determine the order of priority in which they would classify the various recommendations in the Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development adopted by UNISPACE III , the Committee had decided to set up 11 open-ended action teams corresponding to recommendations in priority areas that included disaster management , environmental monitoring strategy , management of Earths resources , promotion of sustainable development , space-based navigation and positioning systems , capacity-building and increasing public awareness of the importance of space activities . 
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively the long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world , in particular in developing countries ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recognizing the importance of continuing international support to the national efforts of the Governments and civil societies of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine , as the most affected countries , to mitigate and minimize the persisting negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the sustainable development of the affected areas as a result of the radiological , health , socio-economic , psychological and environmental consequences of the disaster ,  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

Believe that the strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region , the advances made in peace processes in some countries of the region and greater public awareness have helped to incorporate the environmental dimension into the development process and to make people-centred sustainable development the first priority of the political , economic and social programmes of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Regret that , although the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region have made progress in promoting a more favourable environment for technology transfer and for new clean , energy-efficient approaches to production together with the corresponding technical knowledge particularly through the establishment of suitable systems for the protection of intellectual property , the developed countries have not adopted effective measures for ensuring transfers of , in particular , the most appropriate technologies in terms of environmental , social and economic sustainability .  
Recognize that the viability of sustainable development in the region requires a stable , predictable , open and inclusive international economic system , in which the environmental dimension is acknowledged as an opportunity for investment and trade .  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Recognize that scientific research , technological innovation , and new information and communications technologies can be instrumental in the formulation of economic , social and environmental policies , and should therefore be promoted and facilitated through regional and international cooperation .  
To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To underline the fact that given the existing complementarities among trade , investment , environmental quality , social well-being , growth , the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources and the formation of an open and inclusive world economic system , the environmental dimension constitutes an opportunity rather than a barrier to investment and trade .  
To emphasize that the achievement of sustainable development and the improvement of the quality of life will require more effective integration of environmental , social and economic components of public policies , programmes and projects at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection , and invites them to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ( para .  25.9 ( d ) ) ;  
A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
This political will is reflected in the project for the creation of an Algerian Space Agency , which should help the country to strengthen its national capacities in economic and social development , knowledge of natural resources , environmental protection and the prevention and / or management of major disasters .  
In identifying international cooperation as one of the critical social and economic dimensions in the effort to achieve sustainable development , particularly in developing countries , chapter 2 of Agenda 21 underlines the importance of the international economys providing a supportive international climate for realizing environmental and development goals by promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization and making trade and environment mutually supportive ( para .  2.3 ) .  
With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
Mexico was taking an active part in the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance , whose work , which consisted of making a detailed analysis of current institutional weaknesses and future needs and options in terms of strengthening international environmental governance , would contribute significantly to the Summits preparatory process . 
Since environmental protection was a broad and complex issue with political , economic and social dimensions , the effective implementation of Agenda 21 required a considerable amount of resources , and its management required a multifaceted approach that balanced economic , social and environmental considerations and took into account the regional and international impact of the actions taken .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .  
In the next stages of the preparatory process , the emphasis of the debate would no doubt shift to the relationship between the environment and deepening poverty ; yet the Rio Summit had already exhausted and resolved the issue by stating in Agenda 21 that the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development were equally important .  
In that regard , it was highly advisable to avoid , during the first substantive session of the Preparatory Committee in January 2002 , perpetuating a culture which would lead either side to establish an unwarranted and inappropriate order of priority among the three pillars of sustainable development , namely , economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
The unsuitableness of some of the technology and expertise imported from the advanced countries for economic , social and environmental conditions in the Arab world , and the shortage of skilled national staff capable of working with that technology ;  
The transfer , adaptation and mastery of modern technologies in a manner suited to economic , social and environmental conditions in the Arab States ; the study of those technologies selected for import and the assessment of their applications and their possible effects ; and the remedying of any drawbacks inherent in them before they begin to be applied in the region ;
