Chen Shu-yuan states that many adult observers are surprised to see that the children are quite cultivated in their selection of tapes and videos . While the cartoon is still popular , many cultural offerings have won equal acceptance among the avid participants .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers . Many less ballyhooed works of nearly equal artistic value , overlooked in the commercial furor , sell for quite pedestrian prices .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
Building the ideal of " equal and mutually beneficial relations " : In fact , following the inaugural visit of high-level US or European officials by the French Minister of Industry in January of 1991 , in these two years there have been no less than 50 visits by European or American officials ranked at the vice-minister level or above . Most of them came to Taiwan under the rubric of unofficial participation in privately sponsored conferences on bilateral economic cooperation , and did n't play up their visits along the way .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .

" The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
The abstract proofs of geometry all refer to concrete geometric reality , such as the proof that shows that " the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal . " If the teachers put out a little extra effort , then by rights students in seventh and eighth grade should all have experience making measurements with specific examples .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "

She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration .

" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved .

Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .

The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
The Hong clan 's troupes are also keeping in step with the changing times . Hong Shuiyong , who handles PR , feels that the PRC theater community is wrong to put greater stress on vocals than on acting and the visual aspect . He argues that the two deserve equal priority , and that physically attractive performers who have won prizes should be molded into stars .

All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
The amended family provisions are more equal . There is now much greater flexibility for judges in granting divorces ; any property acquired by a woman before marriage remains hers without the need for further proof that its ownership status has not changed ; and the tradition of nearly always awarding custody of children to the father has been shattered , with the best interests of the child now the standard for deciding custody .  
Roan Ching-yueh , well-known writer and architect , has commented that Taiwan architects are often high above the crowd , separated from the average person by an unbridgeable gap , but the works of Chen Shih-liang " exhibit a desire to make a very friendly connection , " and foster a genuine , enjoyable conversation between those who study the aesthetics of architectural space up in their ivory towers and the people who actually use architectural space . The pictures in his books almost equal the text in volume and afford the reader a unique reading experience .  
For example , he divided each wing into three equal parts and made a downward fold so that a triangular " air channel " was formed where the wings attached to the body . From here he went on to develop various designs of this " air channel plane " that extended and enlarged the channel , creating a plane with a delta-shaped wing similar to a hang glider .  
This agreement guarantees that the reimbursement that the hospital receives for a quarter will be equal to what it received in the same quarter the previous year . However , any claims exceeding this sum will not be honored by the BNHI . In other words , if a hospital 's expenditures surpass the upper limit set by the BNHI , it will likewise face a situation where the more health care services it provides , the greater its financial losses .

In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
I have already stated that the United Nations must play a constructive and catalytic role , within its macroeconomic policies to facilitate economic growth for sustained development , thereby enabling developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of the Members of the Organization , to have an equal share in the opportunities for wealth creation .  
When the United Nations was founded , it inscribed among the purposes set forth in its Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , the development of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Stressing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis , as reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 ,  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Reiterating the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which states that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
The main attention of the agreed conclusions on education and training of women was directed towards the implementation of the goals and benchmarks set by the Platform for Action with regard to the equal and universal access of girls to education . 4 In order to implement those goals and to create an enabling environment to retain women and girls in schools , school authorities , parents , and administrative personnel should , inter alia , ensure safety in schools and during extracurricular activities and organize school teaching programmes , transport , and boarding schools , if necessary . 
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
The DCRK is a unified State of a confederal form in which a unified national Government is established on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other 's ideas and systems , a Government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal power of authority and duties . 
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation has interpreted these provisions as meaning that the basis for the guarantee of equality before the law is the provision of equal treatment to people in reasonably equal circumstances ; this guarantee therefore does not prevent the legislator from giving different consideration to situations he believes to be different , provided that such distinctions are not made using arbitrary criteria leading to undue favour or prejudice , undue personal or class advantages or disadvantages or unlawful persecution .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;

What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .

In strategic objective F . 5 , the Platform for Action calls for the elimination of occupational segregation by promoting the equal participation of women in highly skilled jobs and senior management positions , and through other measures that stimulate women 's on-the-job career development and upward mobility in the labour market , and by stimulating the diversification of occupational choices by both women and men ; women should be encouraged to take up non-traditional jobs ; and men should be encouraged to seek employment in the social sector ( para . 178 ( g ) ) .  
Whereas in almost all countries of the world , with the exception of two , women have the legal right to vote and to hold public office on an equal basis with men , in practice relatively few women have been elected to national legislatures , and even fewer occupy key decision-making positions , including in international organizations such as the United Nations .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .

The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production .

The accession to the WTO means that China 's enterprises will be engaged in equal competition with foreign enterprises from the same starting line in the world economic arena .

Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .

In this way , the Taiwan side can achieve its goal of substituting the fake for the genuine .  When Li Denghui [ Lee Teng-hui ] was in power , the Taiwan authorities played all kinds of tricks .

"

All of the original civil , economic ( intellectual property ) , and communications divisions applied the civil procedure law when trying cases , and all the cases they tried were related to the legal relations between equal and civil entities .

Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
The course of developing our bilateral relations in the nine years since China and Estonia established diplomatic ties shows that the bilateral relations can develop smoothly as long as both sides strictly adhere to the principle of mutual respect , mutual benefit on an equal footing , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality among all countries regardless of size , and abide by the spirit of the China-Estonia Joint Communique and Joint Statement on Establishment of Diplomatic Relations .

Unless the Vatican treats China in an equal and proper way , reflects on the Catholic Church 's bullying of the Chinese people in history by relying on unequal treaties , and uncovers the crimes of Catholic scum in committing rape , loot , and massacre in China , and if it still intends to commemorate a time a century and a half ago when it rode roughshod over China , it can only make a mess of its relations with China and will be unable to obtain any advantage whatever .  
In line with the aim of " consultation on an equal footing , increasing understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and promoting cooperation , " the two sides will jointly discuss major issues , such as how to push for the establishment of a new just and rational , international , political , and economic order geared to the 21st century ; how to safeguard the common interests of developing countries ; and how to further enhance Sino-African trade and economic cooperation .

Finally , Zhang Zuoji said that actively promoting reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban and township professionals is also an important content for perfecting the social insurance system .  We must advance in equal measure reform of both the medical insurance system and the medical agency and pharmaceutical commodity circulation system , guiding all localities to step up implementation of medical insurance system reform programs , truly strengthening basic management , and stable expanding coverage .  
To counter the problems that exist in the implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law , Hou Zongbin said , further efforts should be made to solve the problems of ideological understanding in a bid to genuinely change the erroneous law-enforcement concepts that exist among a considerable number of units and public security cadres and officers , such as " valuing a substantive law more than a procedural law , " and foster a law-enforcement concept of laying equal emphasis on both the substantive law and the procedural law .

Many of the existing favored treatment measures in tariff reduction and waivers can be studied and readjusted ; by this means we can not only expand the tariff base and ensure that revenue will not be reduced as the tariff rate falls but , as the total value of imports rises , tariff revenue will show a big increase , and in particular , it can protect the healthy development of domestic industries in an environment of equal competition and avoid conflicting with the demands of the WTO rules .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .

To do so would set a very bad precedent by giving a special group preferential treatment , contrary to the cardinal principle that all men ( and women ) are equal before the law .  
In anticipation of the implementation of the Mandatory Provident Fund ( MPF ) system , the Government has since mid December 1998 introduced in all new contracts and renewals suitable arrangements for the provision of end-of-contract gratuity .

Chen Shu-yuan states that many adult observers are surprised to see that the children are quite cultivated in their selection of tapes and videos . While the cartoon is still popular , many cultural offerings have won equal acceptance among the avid participants .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers . Many less ballyhooed works of nearly equal artistic value , overlooked in the commercial furor , sell for quite pedestrian prices .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
Building the ideal of " equal and mutually beneficial relations " : In fact , following the inaugural visit of high-level US or European officials by the French Minister of Industry in January of 1991 , in these two years there have been no less than 50 visits by European or American officials ranked at the vice-minister level or above . Most of them came to Taiwan under the rubric of unofficial participation in privately sponsored conferences on bilateral economic cooperation , and did n't play up their visits along the way .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious .

Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel .

"  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
The abstract proofs of geometry all refer to concrete geometric reality , such as the proof that shows that " the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal . " If the teachers put out a little extra effort , then by rights students in seventh and eighth grade should all have experience making measurements with specific examples .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "

She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
The Hong clan 's troupes are also keeping in step with the changing times . Hong Shuiyong , who handles PR , feels that the PRC theater community is wrong to put greater stress on vocals than on acting and the visual aspect . He argues that the two deserve equal priority , and that physically attractive performers who have won prizes should be molded into stars .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .
