Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
Bearing in mind the reaction of the most important international factors , inappropriate to the nature and size of the aggression , the Federal Government has charged the competent authorities with the task of intensifying political , diplomatic and informative activities aimed at having adequate decisions brought by the international community and at fully informing it of the policy of Croatia which constitutes the greatest danger for peace and security in the Balkans .  
As a result , the Assembly adopted , on 23 December 1993 , resolution 48 / 215 A , in which it : ( a ) approved , on an exceptional basis , the creation of the post of Special Adviser at the Under-Secretary-General level against temporary assistance resources for organizing and coordinating activities related to the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations ; and ( b ) requested the Secretary-General to provide adequate secretariat support for the Preparatory Committee .  
Recommends that the international commission of inquiry be composed of five impartial and internationally respected , experienced jurists who shall be selected by the Secretary-General and shall be furnished with adequate expert staff , and that the Government of Burundi be duly informed ;

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization ( a ) faced a potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( b ) was potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing to , inter alia , the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( c ) faced potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops were deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
Studies by UNESCO and other organizations have shown how children no longer trust their parents or teachers , how the professional workforce has abandoned the contaminated regions and how the lack of adequate social and community services has exacerbated people 's profound disorientation and has left them feeling cast adrift .  
In view of the above , the XXth Postal Congress launched an appeal to Governments to provide the postal service with a statute and a modern management system that would guarantee it proper autonomy and adequate human and financial resources based on the notion of profitability .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
Equalizing the risk means raising the quantity , quality and , more importantly , compatibility of preventive and control action at an adequate level on a world-wide scale and putting in place mechanisms designed to maintain and improve that level in a consistent and coordinated fashion .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
In its agreed conclusions / 1995 / 1 , the Economic and Social Council decided that a theme related to the follow-up of conferences , to be considered at the coordination segment , should be chosen at the Council 's previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .  
The Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization : ( i ) faces potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( ii ) is potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing , inter alia , to the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( iii ) faces potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops are deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
The frequent lack of adequate presence in areas where there are internally displaced populations , combined with insufficient understanding of what internal displacement means , has often made it difficult to know the numbers of internally displaced populations and their specific assistance , protection and development needs .  
Programmes and projects submitted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 , provided with adequate funding and approved in accordance with established procedures shall be formalized through specific agreements establishing the objectives , degrees of participation and forms of contribution of each participating country , based on its relative level of development .  
It is encouraging that the Council decided , in its 1995 agreed conclusions , to select the theme related to the follow-up to conferences at its previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .  
The Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to the prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
With the prospect of peace in sight , there was hope that the process of healing the wounds left by acts of unspeakable brutality could be successful if underpinned by firm institutional and legal guarantees and adequate rehabilitation efforts .  
As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;

Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
It is our hope that the international community , represented by the General Assembly , will fulfil its collective responsibility and put an immediate end to the ongoing aggression , prevail upon Israel to implement United Nations resolutions , especially Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , and pay adequate compensation for human losses and the physical damage to Lebanese institutions , historical sites and service facilities .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , 6 / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the United Nations Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook , and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions where they occur ;  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
The Group is pleased that the Commission adopted a resolution that called for the implementation of agreed measures to eradicate poverty and for strengthened international cooperation to that end , and which also called on the international community to mobilize additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
The delegation of Ukraine considers that the issue of special economic assistance to countries affected by the sanctions regime should remain on the agenda of the United Nations , taking into account the fact that the previous resolutions on the issue have not been duly implemented , at least with respect to my country , which has not received adequate assistance to cover the tremendous losses caused by its strict and consistent observance of the sanctions regime .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
37-One respondent was of the view that national master plans should incorporate an adequate demand reduction programme adjusted to local , cultural and other needs .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
33 In addition , the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts encompassed discussions on the development of an adequate legal basis for combatting corruption , including rules and regulations on the conduct of public office holders as well as clear statutory prohibitions , penalties , and procedures for investigating , bringing to trial and punishing persons engaged in corrupt acts .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
For example , in some States , no separate jurisdiction for juveniles exists ; pre-conflict stage resolution is not effectively used ; diversion from criminal justice systems can not be practised because of the absence of adequate alternative programmes ; the administration of juvenile justice is inefficient ; investigation and prosecution procedures are deficient ; placement of juveniles in pre-trial detention is used inappropriately and for too long ; or deprivation of children 's liberty is not used as a last resort but as a general reaction to juvenile delinquency .

According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
In relation to " administering the resources of the Area " , in view of the interest of member States in conservation and rational management in the development of the resources of the Area , the Authority needs an effective and sustained effort to collect , manage and distribute information on the Area in order , inter alia , to provide an adequate understanding of the environmental impact likely to be caused by deep seabed mining , estimate the magnitude of the polymetallic nodule resources in the world 's oceans  
The Group considered that the exploration plan as developed in its report would be completed at the same time that mining and processing technology were tested and considered appropriate , adequate mine sites identified , the market environment proved attractive for investment , and when a decision to proceed to a feasibility study would have to be taken . 
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .

These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
The Declaration on Partnership underscored that there was a need to provide well-targeted and affordable social safety nets by reducing unproductive spending , while ensuring adequate basic investment in infrastructure ; that the sustainability of economic growth depended on the development of human resources ; and that it was highly desirable to reform public pensions , employment insurance , social security and health systems in order to ensure their long-term viability .

He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 6 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;

Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .

Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,

Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Strengthening national research and training institutions at the national and international levels , and improving knowledge sharing and extension mechanisms [ is a ] are critical [ prerequisites ] with respect to increasing absorptive capacity for technology transfer and ensuring adequate capability to adapt these technologies to local conditions .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .

The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,

Data must be adequate , relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which they are held ; be accurate and for the registered purpose ; and surrounded by proper security .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
In all UNDP operational oversight bodies , increasing attention is being paid to the clarity of programme objectives , the extent to which lessons learned have been incorporated into substantive programme design , and the inclusion of adequate performance indicators and managerial arrangements for monitoring and evaluation .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the draft Mining Code provides that activities in the Area " shall be carried out under such conditions that the workers employed in such activities are afforded adequate protection against discrimination in employment on the grounds of race , colour , sex , religion , political opinion , national extraction or social origin , as well as in the fields of occupational safety and health , labour relations , including freedom of association , conditions of work , social security , employment security and living conditions at the worksite " . 
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training , in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse , which should include raising public awareness on the detrimental effects of drug abuse ;  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Similarly , although the Civil Service Regulations make no distinction between the salaries , working hours and period of employment of male and female workers , they fail to provide adequate support for working women , particularly since the pension payable to a woman is not inherited by her family in the event of her death .  Moreover , the social security and health insurance of a working woman do not include her husband and children unless it is confirmed that they are in need and proven that the female employee is directly responsible for their maintenance .  
We express the hope that joint efforts will be successful and effective and that international personnel will receive from the Tajik people adequate support and hospitality , and will thus be able vigorously and fully to discharge the broad range of responsible and important tasks included in the updated UNMOT mandate .  
As outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report of the Secretary-General , adjustments would need to be made to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment during the biennium 1998-1999 in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country and address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Calls upon all States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and support efforts within the United Nations system to adopt effective measures concerning the fulfilment of the right of the child to an adequate standard of living and the continuous and progressive improvement of living and housing conditions as stipulated in the relevant international agreements and conventions ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
At the very minimum , the mandate requires the services of two regular human rights officers , adequate administrative support , and a commensurate level of secretarial expertise .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and United Nations Development Programme technical assistance in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian national police force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalization of the Haitian national police and towards fulfilment of the May 1997 " Haitian national police development plan for 1997-2001 " ,  
Moreover , as stated in paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report , adjustments to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment are proposed during 1998-1999 " in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country , address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies " .  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
While recognizing the ongoing informal consultations between some administering Powers and the Special Committee , those administering Powers should re-establish their formal cooperation with the Special Committee , facilitate the United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their administration to provide adequate up-to-date information on political , economic and social developments in their respective Territories with particular emphasis on their constitutional , political and socio-economic evolution towards exercise of the right to self-determination ;  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the administration of juvenile justice , the Committee recommends that legal reform be pursued in connection with the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children , and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the implementation of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee notes the lack of adequate legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure the full implementation of childrens economic , social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of the State partys available resources , in particular for the most vulnerable children , including girls , children with disabilities , abandoned children , children born out of wedlock , children from single-parent families , children victims of abuse and / or exploitation , and nomadic and refugee children .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
The Policy Forum will provide institutional support for a process of consultation , coordination and action among Governments and other stakeholders interested in taking timely steps towards the establishment of a limited-scale international GHG trading system , possibly starting with a few interested countries , with allowances based on CO2 from major fixed sources and with adequate provisions for the expansion of the trading system to include additional countries , gases , sources and sinks .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
Furthermore , UNHCR emphasized that an essential condition for the prevention of involuntary mass movements is adequate political will on the part of the States directly concerned , and by the international community as a whole .  
Besides , the provisions of existing law are dispersed in a wide variety of international instruments which make them too diffused and unfocused to be effective in providing adequate protection and assistance for the internally displaced .  
Those that have not established such a body should take immediate action to ensure that a national mechanism for guiding and coordinating sustainable development policy be put in place and be given adequate status and resources for effective functioning .

With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
In this area as in so many others effective international cooperation must be based on three key elements : the political will of States , a global approach to the problem , and the allocation of adequate resources to deal with its underlying causes .  
The basic idea was to integrate the most disadvantaged population groups into the national economy and to guarantee them equal opportunity for access to basic services , decent housing , productive employment and an adequate standard of living .  
These 191 States have committed themselves , under article 27 , to recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development .  
It had been pointed out in its biennial report for 19961997 that if the Programmes voice was to be loud enough to be heard above the clamour of unfettered economic growth and globalization it would need adequate , stable and predictable funding .  
We also believe that countries with sophisticated and effective early warning systems have a crucial role to play in providing adequate and timely information to allow developing countries to prepare for impending disasters .  
The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Broader and more equal income distribution at national level required a fair and progressive income taxation system and an adequate social security network , aims which the European Union was committed to supporting .  
In addition , the conversion of policy declarations into concrete policies and actions at both the national and the international levels required not only political will but also adequate allocations of financial and human resources .  
The right to an adequate standard of living is recognized in Australia , and supported by a system of social welfare which protects the most disadvantaged in society _ the unemployed , the sick , the elderly , indigenous peoples and people with disabilities .  
It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .

An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
The elements needed for good governance in the fisheries sector are well recognized : the need for a strategy explicitly aimed at ecological , economic and social sustainability ; effective fisheries agencies and research institutions ; a cooperative , organized and informed fisheries sector ; adequate laws and legal institutions , including deterrent monitoring , control and surveillance ; and appropriate linkages with regional and international bodies .  
The right to a remedy 23 / is indicated to require that : ( i ) each State ensure that adequate remedies are available to any person claiming a violation of rights and ensure their right of access to these remedies ; ( ii ) each legal system provide prompt and effective procedures to ensure readily accessible and adequate remedies , and protection from intimidation and retaliation ; and ( iii ) each State provide universal jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52 / 227 , requested the Secretary-General to take appropriate action to reduce the dependency on the current contractor and to ensure that a comprehensive programme for IMIS training is included as part of the ongoing training programme , and that adequate and qualified staff are assigned to the implementation and operation of the system at all duty stations .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the childs achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
In its resolution 1997 / 35 , on technical cooperation and international advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice , the Economic and Social Council expressed its concern at the lack of adequate resources , which might impede progress in the further operationalization of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and hamper the implementation of those projects that had been elaborated in response to urgent requests from countries in need .  
The Council expressed its concern at the fact that lack of adequate resources might impede progress in the operationalization of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and called upon potential donors and relevant funding agencies to make significant and regular financial contributions for the formulation , coordination and implementation of technical assistance projects elaborated within the framework of the Programme .

They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
In some legal systems , an entity operating under a governmental concession to provide certain essential services ( e.g . electricity or potable water ) to a community or territory and its inhabitants is held to assume an obligation to provide a service system that is reasonably adequate to meet the demand of the community or territory .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
In keeping with its basic mandate , resolution 13 ( I ) of 13 February 1946 , the primary activity of the Department should be to assist and rely upon established governmental and non-governmental agencies of information to provide the public with information about the United Nations ; the Department should engage in activities that will supplement the services of existing agencies of information to the extent that these are insufficient to provide adequate information .  
Reflection and presentation of a timely , accurate , appropriate image of UNEP through systematic dissemination of targeted information on the environmental agenda and initiatives to enlist audience support through the media , and assistance in mobilizing adequate international response to major emerging environmental issues ;

Concerned States will be assisted to secure adequate financial and technical assistance and support for their alternative development programmes , particularly from the international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , relevant United Nations organizations and the private sector .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;

Requests the Secretary-General , in the further enhancement of the career development system of the Organization , to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels ;  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;  
The right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , and expresses deep concern about the number of children living below these standards and infant and child mortality due to preventable diseases , all over the world , in particular in the developing countries ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
Physical accessibility implies that adequate food must be accessible to everyone , including physically vulnerable individuals , such as infants and young children , elderly people , the physically disabled , the terminally ill and persons with persistent medical problems , including the mentally ill .  
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
The study of citizens letters and statements shows that the majority of the communications received by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Oliy Majlis were motivated by the fact that officials who are assigned specific tasks did not solve the problems that were brought before them , were formalistic , indifferent and bureaucratic , and did not provide adequate replies to petitioners concerning the substance of the case .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
The Council may also wish to recommend that the executive boards of the funds and programmes consider the subject of further progress to achieving common premises and shared services , possibly at upcoming joint session of the boards , and consider a practical joint programme of action , including appropriate cost-sharing and adequate financing .  
In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
10 / The right to an adequate standard of living _ or to livelihood - sums up the main concern underlying all economic and social rights , which is to integrate everyone into a humane society . 
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
In its resolution 1999 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , the Economic and Social Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to submit recommendations to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , on how to ensure that the assistance of the international community in supporting the Government of Haiti to achieve sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
Much has yet to be done in order to ensure that ongoing and future international assistance in support of the Government of Haiti for achieving sustainable development continues to be adequate and coherent , and that the main problems related to the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance are addressed .  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
The difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing financial services included the perceived high risks for lenders ; high transaction costs due to the absence of effective methodologies of risk assessment ; the lack of adequate information , such as accounting records and other financial documentation , from the SMEs themselves ; and lenders ' bias in favour of large corporate borrowers .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
The Committee remains concerned about the conditions faced by children deprived of liberty , particularly children detained with adults without adequate protection from inhumane treatment , and about the insufficiency of programmes for the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of juveniles .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
In resolution 53 / 221 , the Secretary-General is requested to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In 1998 , intensive training was conducted for over 60 local counterpart teams in the operation and maintenance of existing water systems in the southern sector , and 45 major feeding centres and main distribution points received adequate supplies of clean water . 
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
The international community has repeatedly condemned the harmful impact of such measures on trade relations among States and on the full realization and enjoyment of human rights , in particular the right to enjoy a standard of living adequate for health and well-being , including food , health care , housing and basic social services , and the right to development .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
I call on Member States to contribute to the trust fund generously on an urgent basis , bearing in mind the vital importance of ensuring adequate financing of these costs for the proper functioning and effectiveness of the Mission . 85 .  The international and local personnel of UNAMET have shown admirable courage and determination in enabling the people of East Timor to choose their destiny .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize adequate technical assistance and funding and to utilize fully existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
As far as the external debt crisis was concerned , the Group of 77 and China welcomed the Cologne initiative and the enhanced HIPC framework which had been adopted at the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which held out the promise of faster , deeper and broader relief ; a critical factor to its success would be the provision of adequate financing .

In many cities , confronted with rapid growth , environmental problems and the slow pace of economic development , it has not been possible to generate sufficient employment , provide adequate housing and meet the basic needs of the citizens .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
It was necessary to promote a broad legal framework that combined adequate recognition of customary law with other instruments of modern law , as well as its adequate protection at the international level .  
Quoting rule 4 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities , 4 the Committee stated that , in addition to the need to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to adequate food , accessible housing and other basic material needs , it was also necessary to ensure that support services , including assisting devices were available for persons with disabilities , so as to assist them in increasing their level of independence in their daily life and in exercising their rights .

Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
Specifically , in resolution 1355 ( 2001 ) of 15 June 2001 , the Council called on all relevant parties to ensure that urgent child protection concerns were addressed in all national , bilateral and regional dialogues and that child soldiers were expeditiously demobilized , and urged Member States to ensure adequate and sustained resources for long-term reintegration .

In order to promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits of globalization , the adequate representation and broad and meaningful participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting should be realized .  
The European Union also wished to stress that the victims of HIV / AIDS should receive adequate social protection ; that minimum standards should be set for social protection tailored to individual countries ; and that it unreservedly supported the Secretary-Generals Global Compact as an instrument for promoting the responsibility of the private sector for social development and social protection .  
By imposing the duty to criminalize prohibited acts and undertake prompt , adequate judicial action under the prosecute or extradite principle , the Convention had filled the gap between the Geneva Conventions and the standard of treatment based on the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and related instruments .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
On the subject of the environment and sustainable development , the Group of 77 and China were indeed pleased with the adoption at the first substantive session of the United Nations Forum on Forests of a multi-year programme of work and a plan of action .  They also wished to emphasize the necessity of providing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification with adequate , predictable and stable financial resources .  
Given that the current difficult situation could be overcome only by a combination of adequate domestic policies and an enabling international environment , the Committee must review the main economic issues and identify areas for cooperation .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .

Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
Further stresses the need for a more comprehensive approach to implementing economic reforms , and underlines the fact that a self-sustainable , market-oriented economy operating in a single economic space , expeditious and transparent privatization , improved banking and capital markets , reformed financial systems , the provision of adequate social protection and the adoption by both entities of a law on pension reform that meet economic standards are crucial for achieving lasting peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina ;

He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .  
Under Expected accomplishments , replace paragraph ( e ) with the following text : improved access by Governments and international bodies to analytical tools , options and adequate methodologies regarding the linkages between political and economic issues and policies , such as economic sanctions , imposition of coercive economic measures , the relationship between disarmament and development and relevant aspects of post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction .  
Ensure international , regional and South-South cooperation , including development assistance and additional adequate resources to implement gender-sensitive policies and programmes aimed at halting the spread of the epidemic in providing affordable quality treatment and care of all people , especially women and girls living with HIV / AIDS ;  
To provide an enabling business environment characterized by stable macroeconomic policies ; a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework ; adequate physical infrastructure , including for transport and telecommunications ; and an available pool of a skilled labour , particularly engineering skills ;  
The failure of HKSAR to establish a national human rights institution with a broad mandate and its failure to establish adequate alternative arrangements for the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Continuing to make available financial resources from all sources , including new and additional resources on an adequate and predictable basis and technical or other resources and facilitating and financing access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , and supporting LDCs efforts in environmental protection in the context of sustainable development ;  
Effectively implementing the enhanced HIPC Initiative and providing adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and providing new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing ; Encouraging Non-Paris Club official creditors to participate in debt relief measures to assist LDCs ;  
Request the Secretary-General to continue to provide the preparatory process and the Conference with all needed support , including a secretariat commensurate with the level of the event and adequate staff and other resources , and including the launching of a global public awareness campaign with as much support as possible from public / private partnerships in order to ensure , in collaboration with the authorities of the host country , the successful realization of the Conference and public awareness of its outcome ;  
Promoting an enabling environment for the conduct of free and fair elections at the commune level through the establishment of an adequate legal framework , the promotion of public awareness on the human rights aspects of elections , and the monitoring of the electoral process .  
Adopt national educational and training strategies which set achievable targets for raising participation levels among young people and which make a strong commitment to adequate and sustained investment in human resource development .

We must build our army in accordance with the general requirement of Chairman Jiang 's remarks that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily .  They must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support .  In this way , we can faithfully carry out well the sacred mission entrusted by the motherland and the people .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
However , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .  Inadequate effective demand and contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure are still very prominent , and no new consumption hot spots are on the horizon .  Problems in our economic life accumulated over the years have all cropped up and the international market still has many uncertain factors - - we should place adequate importance on these problems .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization ( a ) faced a potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( b ) was potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing to , inter alia , the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( c ) faced potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops were deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
Studies by UNESCO and other organizations have shown how children no longer trust their parents or teachers , how the professional workforce has abandoned the contaminated regions and how the lack of adequate social and community services has exacerbated people 's profound disorientation and has left them feeling cast adrift .  
In view of the above , the XXth Postal Congress launched an appeal to Governments to provide the postal service with a statute and a modern management system that would guarantee it proper autonomy and adequate human and financial resources based on the notion of profitability .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
Equalizing the risk means raising the quantity , quality and , more importantly , compatibility of preventive and control action at an adequate level on a world-wide scale and putting in place mechanisms designed to maintain and improve that level in a consistent and coordinated fashion .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
In its agreed conclusions / 1995 / 1 , the Economic and Social Council decided that a theme related to the follow-up of conferences , to be considered at the coordination segment , should be chosen at the Council 's previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .  
The Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization : ( i ) faces potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( ii ) is potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing , inter alia , to the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( iii ) faces potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops are deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
The frequent lack of adequate presence in areas where there are internally displaced populations , combined with insufficient understanding of what internal displacement means , has often made it difficult to know the numbers of internally displaced populations and their specific assistance , protection and development needs .  
Programmes and projects submitted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 , provided with adequate funding and approved in accordance with established procedures shall be formalized through specific agreements establishing the objectives , degrees of participation and forms of contribution of each participating country , based on its relative level of development .  
It is encouraging that the Council decided , in its 1995 agreed conclusions , to select the theme related to the follow-up to conferences at its previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .  
The Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to the prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
With the prospect of peace in sight , there was hope that the process of healing the wounds left by acts of unspeakable brutality could be successful if underpinned by firm institutional and legal guarantees and adequate rehabilitation efforts .  
As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;

Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
It is our hope that the international community , represented by the General Assembly , will fulfil its collective responsibility and put an immediate end to the ongoing aggression , prevail upon Israel to implement United Nations resolutions , especially Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , and pay adequate compensation for human losses and the physical damage to Lebanese institutions , historical sites and service facilities .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , 6 / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the United Nations Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook , and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions where they occur ;  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
The Group is pleased that the Commission adopted a resolution that called for the implementation of agreed measures to eradicate poverty and for strengthened international cooperation to that end , and which also called on the international community to mobilize additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
The delegation of Ukraine considers that the issue of special economic assistance to countries affected by the sanctions regime should remain on the agenda of the United Nations , taking into account the fact that the previous resolutions on the issue have not been duly implemented , at least with respect to my country , which has not received adequate assistance to cover the tremendous losses caused by its strict and consistent observance of the sanctions regime .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
37-One respondent was of the view that national master plans should incorporate an adequate demand reduction programme adjusted to local , cultural and other needs .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
33 In addition , the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts encompassed discussions on the development of an adequate legal basis for combatting corruption , including rules and regulations on the conduct of public office holders as well as clear statutory prohibitions , penalties , and procedures for investigating , bringing to trial and punishing persons engaged in corrupt acts .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
For example , in some States , no separate jurisdiction for juveniles exists ; pre-conflict stage resolution is not effectively used ; diversion from criminal justice systems can not be practised because of the absence of adequate alternative programmes ; the administration of juvenile justice is inefficient ; investigation and prosecution procedures are deficient ; placement of juveniles in pre-trial detention is used inappropriately and for too long ; or deprivation of children 's liberty is not used as a last resort but as a general reaction to juvenile delinquency .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
To establish , maintain and strengthen national and international controls over licit supplies of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors in a manner that ensures adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes while preventing diversion to illicit channels .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
The abuse of drugs and alcohol is an intrinsic threat to such basic goals as economic and social well-being , fundamental human rights and social justice , constructive development , adequate employment and satisfactory conditions of work and pay .

The prime objective of the task forces is to assure that adequate support from the headquarters level is provided to the resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams in each country so that they may , in full consultation with national Governments , facilitate a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences ( para . 39 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 ) .  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .

According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
In relation to " administering the resources of the Area " , in view of the interest of member States in conservation and rational management in the development of the resources of the Area , the Authority needs an effective and sustained effort to collect , manage and distribute information on the Area in order , inter alia , to provide an adequate understanding of the environmental impact likely to be caused by deep seabed mining , estimate the magnitude of the polymetallic nodule resources in the world 's oceans  
The Group considered that the exploration plan as developed in its report would be completed at the same time that mining and processing technology were tested and considered appropriate , adequate mine sites identified , the market environment proved attractive for investment , and when a decision to proceed to a feasibility study would have to be taken . 
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .

The Committee , taking into account difficulties encountered in ensuring adequate preparation of meetings , including timely distribution of documentation , as well as the ability of Member States to participate fully , recommends that the General Assembly should instruct the Main Committees to review the number of special conferences of the United Nations already proposed and scheduled in their respective fields of activity prior to deciding upon the scheduling of new and additional special conferences , thus bearing in mind the relevant portions of General Assembly resolution 33 / 55 . "

UNICEF 's review of country experiences where remarkable social progress has been achieved shows that their common features include strong political commitment to the well-being of children , widespread community participation in the delivery of basic social services and the allocation of adequate resources to the cause of children .  
We express our commitment to the elaboration and implementation of a strategy for the physical integration of the region , aware of the urgent task of developing an adequate transport and communications infrastructure , and we therefore call on the competent national authorities to pursue their efforts in that direction .

Any State that expropriates , nationalizes or takes measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization of property owned by foreign nationals must respect the following rules : such action must be for a public purpose , non-discriminatory , and accompanied by prompt , adequate and effective compensation , granting to the expropriated party effective administrative or judicial review of the measure and quantum of compensation .  
The main lesson learned from the Yugoslav experience was that swift implementation and strict enforcement of the mandatory measures taken by the Security Council are essential in achieving the objectives of the Council and that adequate arrangements for international cooperation and assistance to States in their endeavour to do so can make a considerable contribution to that effect .

The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
The Declaration on Partnership underscored that there was a need to provide well-targeted and affordable social safety nets by reducing unproductive spending , while ensuring adequate basic investment in infrastructure ; that the sustainability of economic growth depended on the development of human resources ; and that it was highly desirable to reform public pensions , employment insurance , social security and health systems in order to ensure their long-term viability .  
Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;

Welcomes action at the national and regional level by small island developing States , and invites all Governments , with the assistance of international and regional organizations , to continue to support and to provide information on all of their major activities under the Programme of Action so as to enable an adequate review of the aforementioned action taken at the national and regional level ;  
The needs in the region are more comprehensive than the institution of port State control , and concern also the lack of adequate maritime administrative infrastructure , of national legislation to implement the requirements of international maritime conventions , and trained personnel at all levels . 
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 6 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;

Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .  
The measures adopted to recognize and ensure the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ;

Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,

Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Strengthening national research and training institutions at the national and international levels , and improving knowledge sharing and extension mechanisms [ is a ] are critical [ prerequisites ] with respect to increasing absorptive capacity for technology transfer and ensuring adequate capability to adapt these technologies to local conditions .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,

Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
Data must be adequate , relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which they are held ; be accurate and for the registered purpose ; and surrounded by proper security .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
In all UNDP operational oversight bodies , increasing attention is being paid to the clarity of programme objectives , the extent to which lessons learned have been incorporated into substantive programme design , and the inclusion of adequate performance indicators and managerial arrangements for monitoring and evaluation .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the draft Mining Code provides that activities in the Area " shall be carried out under such conditions that the workers employed in such activities are afforded adequate protection against discrimination in employment on the grounds of race , colour , sex , religion , political opinion , national extraction or social origin , as well as in the fields of occupational safety and health , labour relations , including freedom of association , conditions of work , social security , employment security and living conditions at the worksite " . 
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training , in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse , which should include raising public awareness on the detrimental effects of drug abuse ;  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Similarly , although the Civil Service Regulations make no distinction between the salaries , working hours and period of employment of male and female workers , they fail to provide adequate support for working women , particularly since the pension payable to a woman is not inherited by her family in the event of her death .  Moreover , the social security and health insurance of a working woman do not include her husband and children unless it is confirmed that they are in need and proven that the female employee is directly responsible for their maintenance .  
We express the hope that joint efforts will be successful and effective and that international personnel will receive from the Tajik people adequate support and hospitality , and will thus be able vigorously and fully to discharge the broad range of responsible and important tasks included in the updated UNMOT mandate .  
As outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report of the Secretary-General , adjustments would need to be made to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment during the biennium 1998-1999 in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country and address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Calls upon all States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and support efforts within the United Nations system to adopt effective measures concerning the fulfilment of the right of the child to an adequate standard of living and the continuous and progressive improvement of living and housing conditions as stipulated in the relevant international agreements and conventions ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
At the very minimum , the mandate requires the services of two regular human rights officers , adequate administrative support , and a commensurate level of secretarial expertise .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and United Nations Development Programme technical assistance in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian national police force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalization of the Haitian national police and towards fulfilment of the May 1997 " Haitian national police development plan for 1997-2001 " ,  
Moreover , as stated in paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report , adjustments to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment are proposed during 1998-1999 " in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country , address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies " .  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
While recognizing the ongoing informal consultations between some administering Powers and the Special Committee , those administering Powers should re-establish their formal cooperation with the Special Committee , facilitate the United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their administration to provide adequate up-to-date information on political , economic and social developments in their respective Territories with particular emphasis on their constitutional , political and socio-economic evolution towards exercise of the right to self-determination ;  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the administration of juvenile justice , the Committee recommends that legal reform be pursued in connection with the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children , and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the implementation of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee notes the lack of adequate legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure the full implementation of childrens economic , social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of the State partys available resources , in particular for the most vulnerable children , including girls , children with disabilities , abandoned children , children born out of wedlock , children from single-parent families , children victims of abuse and / or exploitation , and nomadic and refugee children .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
The Policy Forum will provide institutional support for a process of consultation , coordination and action among Governments and other stakeholders interested in taking timely steps towards the establishment of a limited-scale international GHG trading system , possibly starting with a few interested countries , with allowances based on CO2 from major fixed sources and with adequate provisions for the expansion of the trading system to include additional countries , gases , sources and sinks .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .

The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
In this area as in so many others effective international cooperation must be based on three key elements : the political will of States , a global approach to the problem , and the allocation of adequate resources to deal with its underlying causes .

The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Broader and more equal income distribution at national level required a fair and progressive income taxation system and an adequate social security network , aims which the European Union was committed to supporting .

IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .

Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .

Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved .

While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
The study of citizens letters and statements shows that the majority of the communications received by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Oliy Majlis were motivated by the fact that officials who are assigned specific tasks did not solve the problems that were brought before them , were formalistic , indifferent and bureaucratic , and did not provide adequate replies to petitioners concerning the substance of the case .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .

In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
10 / The right to an adequate standard of living _ or to livelihood - sums up the main concern underlying all economic and social rights , which is to integrate everyone into a humane society . 
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
In its resolution 1999 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , the Economic and Social Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to submit recommendations to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , on how to ensure that the assistance of the international community in supporting the Government of Haiti to achieve sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
Much has yet to be done in order to ensure that ongoing and future international assistance in support of the Government of Haiti for achieving sustainable development continues to be adequate and coherent , and that the main problems related to the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance are addressed .  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
The difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing financial services included the perceived high risks for lenders ; high transaction costs due to the absence of effective methodologies of risk assessment ; the lack of adequate information , such as accounting records and other financial documentation , from the SMEs themselves ; and lenders ' bias in favour of large corporate borrowers .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
The Committee remains concerned about the conditions faced by children deprived of liberty , particularly children detained with adults without adequate protection from inhumane treatment , and about the insufficiency of programmes for the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of juveniles .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
In resolution 53 / 221 , the Secretary-General is requested to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In 1998 , intensive training was conducted for over 60 local counterpart teams in the operation and maintenance of existing water systems in the southern sector , and 45 major feeding centres and main distribution points received adequate supplies of clean water . 
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
The international community has repeatedly condemned the harmful impact of such measures on trade relations among States and on the full realization and enjoyment of human rights , in particular the right to enjoy a standard of living adequate for health and well-being , including food , health care , housing and basic social services , and the right to development .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
I call on Member States to contribute to the trust fund generously on an urgent basis , bearing in mind the vital importance of ensuring adequate financing of these costs for the proper functioning and effectiveness of the Mission . 85 .  The international and local personnel of UNAMET have shown admirable courage and determination in enabling the people of East Timor to choose their destiny .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize adequate technical assistance and funding and to utilize fully existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
As far as the external debt crisis was concerned , the Group of 77 and China welcomed the Cologne initiative and the enhanced HIPC framework which had been adopted at the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which held out the promise of faster , deeper and broader relief ; a critical factor to its success would be the provision of adequate financing . 
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .
