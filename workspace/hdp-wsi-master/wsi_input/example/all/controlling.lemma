and published a serial roundup in " Renmin Zhengxie Bao [ CPPCC Paper ] . "  In order to coordinate with the central topic for discussion at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee , namely , the question of environment and development , the Motions Committee also synthesized more than 300 motions about harnessing the river , lake , and sea pollution ; preventing and controlling the urban atmospheric pollution ;  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
Article 6 A system of controlling the total discharge volume of major pollutants may be instituted for a body of water that still falls short of the water environmental quality standards set by the state even after its water pollutant discharge quotas have been fulfilled .  
The targets for controlling COD , nitrogen , phosphorus , and petroleum should comprehensively attain the requirements for controlling the volume and the total amount of pollutants ; the water quality of near-shore water areas should comprehensively attain the defined environmental protection targets in areas according to their functions .  The ecology should basically realize a benign cycle , and the environment of a number of key sea areas should be comprehensively improved .  
Currently China 's foreign bond issues are regulated primarily under the pertinent State Council regulations on further strengthening the macro control over the use of international commercial loans , the State Development Planning Commission 's circular on comprehensive planned management of foreign debts , and the People 's Bank of China 's " Measures Controlling the Internal Institutions ' Issuance of Foreign Currency-based Bonds , " and so on .  There is no systematic law or regulation controlling the issuance of debt instruments overseas , and we urgently need to improve the relevant laws and regulations .  
" On the premises that the public ownership persistently holds a dominant position , the national economic lifelines are under the state 's control , and the controlling and competitive power of the state-owned economy is growing strong , a certain reduction in the proportion of the state-owned economy will not affect the socialist nature of China . "  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .

Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
We should put the improvement of quality and enhancement of economic result high on the agenda .  Guided by the market , we should make active efforts to push forward the structural adjustment , do a good job in controlling total supply and total demand , resolutely eliminate enterprises with inferior production capability , and avoid making the same mistake of duplicating construction projects .  We should integrate the periodical goal with the long-term goal of carrying out the reform and development of state-owned enterprises .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .

Discussing the current work of taking stock of and straightening out " state investments , " Dai Xianglong revealed that in the past one or two years the central bank has held frequent consultations with local governments on the question of straightening out trust and investment companies , because the great majority of these companies , apart from a few , are the equity controlling or total investment companies of the local governments .  
Taking a general look at cults of various kinds , although there are differences in category , in era , and title , they all have common characteristics in worshipping the master , preaching the " theory of the end of the world , " mentally controlling their followers , taking people 's belongings by force or trickery , accumulating wealth by unfair means , forming secret associations , revolting against society , and mentally and physically crippling their disciples , and their antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence is cut from the same cloth .  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
The draft outline of the 10th Five-year Plan now being examined and discussed by the " two sessions " mentions : China will gradually implement national treatment for foreign investment enterprises , and draw up a unified , standard , and transparent policy on permitting market entry ; and restrictions on the equity ratio in enterprises will be removed , except for important sectors and enterprises related to national security and national economic lifelines , in which the state must hold the controlling equity .

In the four months since it took office , the Bush Administration has stirred up trouble everywhere ; from pushing the MD system heedless of the international community 's opposition , to refusing to implement the " Kyoto protocol " aimed at controlling global warming , and on top of that , gesticulating at the establishment of an independent defense force by the EU , the United States has practiced a kind of arrogant and selfish unilateralist policy .

Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .

If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .
