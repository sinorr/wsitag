Nie Beiyin , Zhongguo Qingnian Bao reporter : As we know , unlike the radical " shock therapy " adopted by the former Soviet Union and East Europe " in the hope of thoroughly casting off stagnation by a leap , " China 's economic reform is called a " progressive reform " by the transitional economic theorists at home and abroad , because it has been moving forward " step by step in a steady and planned way under the unified leadership of the central authorities . "  
Advanced cultures are healthy , scientific , progressive , represent the development direction of the future , and promote social development .  They are not decadent , passive , ignorant , or backward , nor do they hinder social development .  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the ï¿½t hree represents .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
In 1999 , news propaganda units publicized odes to the motherland , socialism , and China 's reform and opening up , stimulated the people 's patriotic enthusiasms , rallied the people 's national spirit , safeguarded social stability , and created public opinion which has been optimistic , progressive , united , and forging ahead .  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
Without its progressive ideology and culture , without a unified national spirit , without correct values , it will be hard for a nation to hold an independent , self-determining , and self-strengthening status , and then such a nation will be susceptible to foreign influences and pressure .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
In the past half-century , the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee carried forward Mr . Sun Yat-sen 's patriotic , revolutionary , and progressive spirit ; voluntarily subjected itself to the leadership of the CPC , played an active role as a party involved in administration , made contributions to the great cause of national reunification and regeneration ;  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .  We should strive to turn our advantageous journalistic resources , cultural resources , and information technology resources into our superiority in online propaganda so that the online position and the mass media in our country will all be occupied with progressive ideology and culture .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
However , no other political organization had so many progressive elements as our party gathered , and was organized so tightly as our party , and made so great sacrifices for the Chinese nation , and could maintain so close ties with the people .  The party formed and maintained its correct theory and line as it was good at summing up experience in the course of advancing .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
Over the past few years , thanks to the joint efforts exerted by the entire party and the whole society , the essential aspect of the style of thinking and moral qualities of the whole society is active , healthy and progressive .  Gratifying changes have taken place in the mental outlook of our people .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
China must be led by a progressive political party armed with advanced ideology and only thus can national liberation and regeneration be realized .  This is the conclusion drawn from the modern history of China .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .

In the world 's great struggle against Fascism , in the sacred cause of the Asian , African and Latin American people fighting for national independence and liberation , and in the tireless efforts to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international order , we have always stood on the side of justice and worked in unity with the people of all countries and all the progressive forces in the world .  
Summing up the course of endeavor and basic experiences over 80 years , and looking to the arduous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must - - in sum - - always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .

In fact , progressive figures in Japanese society have consistently exposed the reactionary essence of the Yasukuni Shrine , and the families of some of the " war dead " who clearly understand the essence of the evil of the war have also expressed that their dear ones were victims misled by the spirit of the Yasukuni Shrine , and some of these people have taken part in recent street processions opposing Koizumi 's paying respects there .  
The Speech sums up the basic experiences of the CPC over the past 80 years , looks forward to the tremendous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , and profoundly points out that for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must , in sum , always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .

We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .

Nie Beiyin , Zhongguo Qingnian Bao reporter : As we know , unlike the radical " shock therapy " adopted by the former Soviet Union and East Europe " in the hope of thoroughly casting off stagnation by a leap , " China 's economic reform is called a " progressive reform " by the transitional economic theorists at home and abroad , because it has been moving forward " step by step in a steady and planned way under the unified leadership of the central authorities . "  
Advanced cultures are healthy , scientific , progressive , represent the development direction of the future , and promote social development .  They are not decadent , passive , ignorant , or backward , nor do they hinder social development .  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the ï¿½t hree represents .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .

This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .

The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
In the past half-century , the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee carried forward Mr . Sun Yat-sen 's patriotic , revolutionary , and progressive spirit ; voluntarily subjected itself to the leadership of the CPC , played an active role as a party involved in administration , made contributions to the great cause of national reunification and regeneration ;  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .  We should strive to turn our advantageous journalistic resources , cultural resources , and information technology resources into our superiority in online propaganda so that the online position and the mass media in our country will all be occupied with progressive ideology and culture .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
However , no other political organization had so many progressive elements as our party gathered , and was organized so tightly as our party , and made so great sacrifices for the Chinese nation , and could maintain so close ties with the people .  The party formed and maintained its correct theory and line as it was good at summing up experience in the course of advancing .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
Over the past few years , thanks to the joint efforts exerted by the entire party and the whole society , the essential aspect of the style of thinking and moral qualities of the whole society is active , healthy and progressive .  Gratifying changes have taken place in the mental outlook of our people .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
China must be led by a progressive political party armed with advanced ideology and only thus can national liberation and regeneration be realized .  This is the conclusion drawn from the modern history of China .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .

Summing up the course of endeavor and basic experiences over 80 years , and looking to the arduous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must - - in sum - - always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .

In fact , progressive figures in Japanese society have consistently exposed the reactionary essence of the Yasukuni Shrine , and the families of some of the " war dead " who clearly understand the essence of the evil of the war have also expressed that their dear ones were victims misled by the spirit of the Yasukuni Shrine , and some of these people have taken part in recent street processions opposing Koizumi 's paying respects there .  
The Speech sums up the basic experiences of the CPC over the past 80 years , looks forward to the tremendous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , and profoundly points out that for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must , in sum , always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .

His Government was firmly committed to taking part in the activities planned for the final term of the Decade , and was confident that the Decade would make a significant contribution to the progressive development of international law , particularly in creating favourable legal conditions for the justice which was the basis for lasting peace .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 10 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 23 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
The Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
It is our hope that 1997 will see the progressive diminution of the remaining tensions and suspicions , and the fostering of a spirit of constructive and positive cooperation between the different communities , from which can grow lasting stability and economic prosperity based on mutual respect , democracy and the rule of law .  
This affirmative vote will , however , reflect more our firm and overriding attachment to the overall process of codification and progressive development of international law , rather than a strong conviction that the text of the draft Convention now before us is a fully satisfactory and balanced one which could not have been improved in some of its major aspects .  
Thirdly , since the draft Convention sets out a framework regime that lays down general rules intended to promote equitable and reasonable cooperation between downstream and upstream States in the use of international watercourses , and in the hope that its implementation will make a genuine contribution to the progressive development of international law , the Slovak Republic is in a position to vote in favour of the draft framework Convention .  
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
The Working Group took the view that consideration by the Commission of unilateral acts by States , with a view to initiating work on the codification and progressive development of the applicable legal rules , is advisable and feasible , bearing in mind , inter alia , the following reasons : _ In their conduct in the international sphere , States frequently carry out unilateral acts with the intent to produce legal effects . 
The themes of the Colloquium will be : an overview of the international law-making process and the role of the International Law Commission ; major complexities encountered in contemporary international law-making ; selection of topics for codification and progressive development by the Commission and its working methods ; the Commissions work and the shaping of international law ; enhancing the Commissions relationship with other law-making bodies and relevant academic and professional institutions ; and making international law more relevant and readily available .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Calls upon all States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and support efforts within the United Nations system to adopt effective measures concerning the fulfilment of the right of the child to an adequate standard of living and the continuous and progressive improvement of living and housing conditions as stipulated in the relevant international agreements and conventions ;  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
The view was expressed that the Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
The extended closings of the West Bank and Gaza with the resulting disastrous economic consequences , the progressive isolation of Palestinians from access to Jerusalem , the establishment and expansion of settlements , the denial of access to refugees and the endless incarceration of prisoners , among other issues , have indelibly marked our hearts and stirred our collective sense of determination to persist in this work .  
The progressive movement from exclusive reliance on remote monitoring by national technical means towards more cooperative and intrusive methods , including on-site inspections , is a noteworthy trend that is likely to continue with START III .  
In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .  
Broader and more equal income distribution at national level required a fair and progressive income taxation system and an adequate social security network , aims which the European Union was committed to supporting .  
It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .  
What is being sought is for the international community , represented by the Conference on Disarmament and the NPT , to have focused deliberations on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .

Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
Reaffirmation , in this context by the nuclear-weapons States , of their faithful commitment to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons , and their means of delivery , and to that end , agreement to pursue vigorously systematic and progressive efforts to further reduce nuclear weapons , globally and regionally . ( delete - Declaration of commitment to the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ) .

. . . a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations , to the end that every individual and every organ of society . . . shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures , national and international , to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance . . . 
In addition to providing basic services for our society and improving economic performance , the challenges of the future will make it necessary to build bridges across generations and create a more understanding and progressive cultural milieu in which young and old together embrace the new values of our evolving societies while respecting the traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers . 
We reiterate our call on all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urge them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort - at the political , economic and social levels - will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .

While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
Russia was firmly convinced that the successful development of international cooperation in space on a regional and bilateral basis and its establishment on a long-term legal foundation were no substitute for the progressive development and modification of universal norms and principles of such cooperation .  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort at the political , economic and social levels will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
Detailed information , including the latest statistical data , is also requested on the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights in East Jerusalem , keeping in mind the concerns raised by the Committee in the relevant paragraphs of these concluding observations .

Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 2 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
The PRESIDENT : On the second issue , I would like to recall that the representative of South Africa made a proposal at the first plenary meeting on 19 January 1999 to establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to deliberate upon practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as well as to identify if and when one or more such steps should be subject to negotiations in the Conference .

The Administration was determined to pursue its current efforts to consolidate its achievements in social , cultural , economic and political fields , and to intensify its endeavours to ensure the progressive enjoyment of all aspects of human rights by the people of Myanmar .  
The promise of deep , progressive and irreversible reductions inherent in unilateral and bilateral efforts remains to be fully implemented and may even be threatened by the unravelling of solemn agreements and treaties which served valuable stabilizing roles .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;  
However , even the poorest country is bound to ensure the highest level their resources will permit and , at the very least , a basic minimum level of economic , social and cultural rights . 20 The concept of progressive realization can not be used to justify persistent injustice and inequality . 
In contrast to economic , social and cultural rights , international humanitarian law is not subject to progressive realization , but must always be implemented immediately .  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
Towards this objective and in the light of the gradual forward deployment of the Mission and progressive control of areas held by RUF , the critical aspects that these efforts specifically necessitate are the promotion of the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , the truth and reconciliation process , the peace-building activities of UNAMSIL and preparations for national elections . 
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , [ 3 ] the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,
