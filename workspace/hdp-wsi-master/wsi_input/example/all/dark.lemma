The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;  
We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .  
Through repeated drills , the pilots have explored ways to cleverly avoid enemies by using such unfavorable weather conditions as before dawn , at dusk , and at dark night , and mastered various skills of rapid and precise landing on a multiple points , and coordination between helicopters and the special task forces on the ground to launch an assault against the enemy .

After the sugar coating was licked off , what one may taste was only the bitterness inside .  If the voters are aware of the sugar coating and the packing , then they should know that even though opposing dark gold politics , restoring law and order , and reforming government were all what they required , if these objectives were to be achieved only by means of establishing a so-called Taiwan people 's state , then nothing would really be accomplished .

After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
The illegal MLM activities currently prevalent in the Guangdong region are camouflaged with a variety of names .  They tend to disguise themselves as " consumer alliances , " " framework marketing , " or " composite allied chains , " luring or coercing a large number of members of the public , who are kept in the dark , to take part .  This has been very harmful to social stability and the economic order across the province .

Situated across from a rural community , far from the hustle-and-bustle of the big cities , a very exotic tropical paradise overlooks the ocean : dark blue water for as far as the eye can see .

The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life .

Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture .

It 's not that I 'm hard to scare ( God has given me an adrenal gland , which is His way of telling me to be scared ) .

Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets .

Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs .

This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing .

We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .
