After two years ' efforts , the " 148 " legal service hotline , which originated from Shandong , has spread all over the country .  It has become an important channel for party and government leaders and the public to know and understand judicial and administrative work , and an important means to bring the complex functional advantages of grassroots judicial and administrative departments into play and to strengthen grassroots judicial and administrative work .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .

The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .

Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China .

The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .

Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .

In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical stage , and the unfinished final position negotiations involve the most complex and sensitive issues ; it is difficult to take one step forward , which requires tremendous efforts on both sides .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .

In the course of repeated investigation , the joint investigation team organized by the CCDI and the State Administration of Taxation discovered through open investigation and covert visits that not only was the case highly complex but also that there were very big obstacles ; it involved certain Hong Kong businessmen as well as the principal leaders of Guangdong and Chaoshan .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .

The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "

Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .

As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .

Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
It is essential to have a profound understanding of the long-term , arduous and complex nature of the work against corruption .  Not only is it necessary to be prepared for protracted battles , but also intensify our efforts to address current issues .

At present , the international situation is complex and dynamic , our reform and construction are at a crucial moment of development and our Party 's self-construction is in a new stage of development .  Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " will greatly accelerate theory innovation , system innovation and scientific and technological innovation in our Party and our country .  The PLA is an important force to embody the Party 's and the national political advantages .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .

For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .

Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Zhu Rongji summed up the state of the Chinese economy as follows : Since the Asian financial crisis , while the Chinese economy has sustained a severe and complex test , it has still kept quite a fast growth momentum , particularly in 2000 , when it has made a crucial turnaround .  Our economy is growing fast , with its efficiency markedly improved , foreign trade growth being strong , consumption tending to be brisk in the midst of stability , revenue up sharply , and foreign exchange reserves continuing to increase .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
Charged with the onerous and complex tasks of fixing posts for personnel and locating posts for some personnel , local organizational and personnel departments have formulated policies to advance reform in the spirit of being responsible for every civil servant , organizing the competitive assignment of posts and two-way choosing .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
Young party members and young cadres should inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work style , display a spirit of hard struggle , firmly foster the mass viewpoint , conscientiously accept the tempering and test in a hard and complex environment , and sublimate their own will , character and mental state during the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Under the wise decision-making of the Party Central Committee , in the midst of a complex and ever-changing international situation , we have further established and unified a series of important national strategic relations , improving China 's international status .  
Jiang Zemin said that western development is a vast systems engineering , which is related to developing our vast land and also involves the production and daily life of the multiethnic masses ; it has to promote economic construction , and also achieve coordinated economic , resource , population , cultural , and environmental development ; there are very many strands to this work , which is very complex and arduous .  
In the face of harsh struggles between infiltration and anti-infiltration and between separatism and anti-separatism , we should attach greater importance to and do more to enhance nationality unity than any time in the past ; it is first of all necessary to manage well affairs of the nationality regions .  The key is to work hard to train and develop many high-quality minority nationality cadres characterized by firm stances , being clear-headed , being capable of handling and controlling various complex situations , and being capable of standing various tests .  
Under the current complex and fast-changing international situation , it is hoped that China and the EU will take long-term and fundamental interests of both sides into consideration in handling bilateral ties .  He hoped the two sides would strengthen consultation and coordination on major international affairs and push forward the constructive partnership [ jian she xing huo ban guan xi ] between China and Europe .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .  
All these fully indicate the outstanding ability and leadership art of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in controlling the overall economic situation under complex international and domestic situations .  These also suggest that the central authorities ' major decisions , principles , and policies on economic work are absolutely correct .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
Hu Jintao emphasized : In the face of complex , changeable international situation at the turn of the century , the further strengthening and development of PRC-DPRK traditional friendship is not only in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the two parties and two countries , but also conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula , Northeast Asia , and the world as a whole .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "

However , because of his complex social relations and numerous hatchet men , the public security department adopted a cautious approach by establishing a special committee , adopted high-tech means , and deployed several special agents to conduct the investigation under absolute secrecy for nearly one year to collect concrete evidence .

Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .

The most sought-after qualities for the traditional Taiwanese opera are a beautiful and intricate voice , figure , and acting skill . To accommodate the television medium , with its fast and furious pace , much of the complex vocals and acting have been cut out . It 's unavoidable that the original flavor of the operas is lost .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .

One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .  
Innate rebelliousness combined with his father 's authoritarianism formed a character that is hard to fathom - - plain and taciturn on the surface , but complex and changeable inside , with more than a dash of the unexpected .  
This is not a particularly difficult task , but it is time consuming and extremely complex because there were no standard editions of the repertoires performed by folk opera troupes , and a tradition of oral transmission inevitably results in textual discrepancies and variants . The old artistes are usually illiterate and are often on the verge of senility , so they frequently do not understand the words they are singing themselves !

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
My foreigner friends were warmhearted and dear , but for someone like myself , with an especially heavy China complex , who feels down in the dumps after not chatting in Chinese or not seeing another person with black hair and tawny skin for too long , things could get pretty lonesome , and my longing for home and country would often flood over me in waves and drown me .

Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .

Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology .

However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .

Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China .

In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical stage , and the unfinished final position negotiations involve the most complex and sensitive issues ; it is difficult to take one step forward , which requires tremendous efforts on both sides .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .

In the course of repeated investigation , the joint investigation team organized by the CCDI and the State Administration of Taxation discovered through open investigation and covert visits that not only was the case highly complex but also that there were very big obstacles ; it involved certain Hong Kong businessmen as well as the principal leaders of Guangdong and Chaoshan .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .

The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "

Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .

As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .

Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .

At present , the international situation is complex and dynamic , our reform and construction are at a crucial moment of development and our Party 's self-construction is in a new stage of development .  Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " will greatly accelerate theory innovation , system innovation and scientific and technological innovation in our Party and our country .  The PLA is an important force to embody the Party 's and the national political advantages .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .

For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .

Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Zhu Rongji summed up the state of the Chinese economy as follows : Since the Asian financial crisis , while the Chinese economy has sustained a severe and complex test , it has still kept quite a fast growth momentum , particularly in 2000 , when it has made a crucial turnaround .  Our economy is growing fast , with its efficiency markedly improved , foreign trade growth being strong , consumption tending to be brisk in the midst of stability , revenue up sharply , and foreign exchange reserves continuing to increase .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .

Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
Young party members and young cadres should inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work style , display a spirit of hard struggle , firmly foster the mass viewpoint , conscientiously accept the tempering and test in a hard and complex environment , and sublimate their own will , character and mental state during the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Under the wise decision-making of the Party Central Committee , in the midst of a complex and ever-changing international situation , we have further established and unified a series of important national strategic relations , improving China 's international status .  
Jiang Zemin said that western development is a vast systems engineering , which is related to developing our vast land and also involves the production and daily life of the multiethnic masses ; it has to promote economic construction , and also achieve coordinated economic , resource , population , cultural , and environmental development ; there are very many strands to this work , which is very complex and arduous .  
In the face of harsh struggles between infiltration and anti-infiltration and between separatism and anti-separatism , we should attach greater importance to and do more to enhance nationality unity than any time in the past ; it is first of all necessary to manage well affairs of the nationality regions .  The key is to work hard to train and develop many high-quality minority nationality cadres characterized by firm stances , being clear-headed , being capable of handling and controlling various complex situations , and being capable of standing various tests .  
Under the current complex and fast-changing international situation , it is hoped that China and the EU will take long-term and fundamental interests of both sides into consideration in handling bilateral ties .  He hoped the two sides would strengthen consultation and coordination on major international affairs and push forward the constructive partnership [ jian she xing huo ban guan xi ] between China and Europe .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .  
All these fully indicate the outstanding ability and leadership art of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in controlling the overall economic situation under complex international and domestic situations .  These also suggest that the central authorities ' major decisions , principles , and policies on economic work are absolutely correct .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
Hu Jintao emphasized : In the face of complex , changeable international situation at the turn of the century , the further strengthening and development of PRC-DPRK traditional friendship is not only in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the two parties and two countries , but also conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula , Northeast Asia , and the world as a whole .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "

However , because of his complex social relations and numerous hatchet men , the public security department adopted a cautious approach by establishing a special committee , adopted high-tech means , and deployed several special agents to conduct the investigation under absolute secrecy for nearly one year to collect concrete evidence .

Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .

The most sought-after qualities for the traditional Taiwanese opera are a beautiful and intricate voice , figure , and acting skill . To accommodate the television medium , with its fast and furious pace , much of the complex vocals and acting have been cut out . It 's unavoidable that the original flavor of the operas is lost .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .

One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
My foreigner friends were warmhearted and dear , but for someone like myself , with an especially heavy China complex , who feels down in the dumps after not chatting in Chinese or not seeing another person with black hair and tawny skin for too long , things could get pretty lonesome , and my longing for home and country would often flood over me in waves and drown me .

However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .
