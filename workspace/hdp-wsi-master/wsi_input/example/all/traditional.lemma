Pop queen Madonna 's upcoming spiritual tour to Israel to study a mysterious Jewish philosophy has raised questions over her true faith .  Does the self-proclaimed material girl really have faith in the traditional ancient Jewish mysticism or is this simply the latest fashion of self-help for celebrities .  
Wu said China and Ethiopia boast traditional friendship and they have always supported each other , shared common views on many major international and regional issues , and maintained sound consultations and cooperation in international affairs .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
In the coming 5 years , the step of attracting investments should be accelerated ; industry structures , product structures and enterprise structures will be gradually adjusted .  " Three transformations " are to be realized : to immediately develop from single export processing to comprehensive functionality , to transform from a focus on traditional industries into focusing on developing of the new technology industry , and to transform from a focus on scattered , small-scale investment attraction into actively introducing large industry &amp; trade projects from foreign multinational companies and groups .  
At the same time , the Bank of China has also paid attention to bringing all advantages into full play , actively developing the work of marketing ; making the traditional business of international settlement continue to maintain an advantageous position in furious market competition ; and also gained the new development of intermediate services such as foreign exchange settlement and sales , credit cards , agents , substitute charges , etc .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
Its aim is to use Chinese national traditional culture as a link to associate and unite compatriots at home and abroad , to spread national culture , to display the charm of the superior art of the motherland and display the achievements and elegant demeanor of overseas Chinese , Chinese artists in art realms and international cultural exchange .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
Especially in recent years , with continued enhancement of using technology in the weaponry and constant introduction of high new technology , the traditional " men of unusual strength " and " fleet-footed runners " are no longer the tops in training of the missile company .  To replace them are the " software fans " capable of planning and managing commands from the commanding center by softly clicking the mouse in front of the computer screen and the " computer experts " skilled in using software to launch missiles .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
While participating in a discussion held by the Beijing NPC Delegation , Deputy Wu Bangguo , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : It is necessary to use new and high technologies to transform traditional industries and to vigorously develop emerging industries as well as new and high-tech industries so as to advance the readjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
He stated that " in places with deep-rooted traditional cultures , even if it is extremely poor , there is still the setting sun of the tropics and comfort from stable homes that is inspiring , but the poor in the United States do n't even have these , and they often live irregular lives in which even hope has been stripped away . "  ( See Hong Kong " Ming Pao , " 7 December 1994 . )  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Furthermore , all-weather , 24-hour , omnidirectional , highly-dynamic space photography can acquire multifrequency , multiphase , high-resolution space image data rapidly and in a timely manner .  By using this image data and photogrammetry technology , not only is it possible to create traditional paper maps , it is also possible to build digital elevation models , produce digital orthographic projection maps and digital topographical maps , satisfying the need to support long-range weapons , cruise missiles , and other such precision guided weapons .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
Both the traditional enemies and long-standing allies of the United States heaved a sigh as if relieved of a heavy load , praising the US president for deciding to shelve the NMD program and leave his successor to decide whether or not to deploy the system , which is regarded as a threat to the global arms balance , and saying that the president has made a wise decision which will avoid upsetting the global balance of power .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
In the course of economic development , we have long been accustomed to the traditional model of economic growth , so that the situation of blind investment , redundant construction , " large and all-embracing " , and " small and self-contained " was very serious , and many industries had enormous excess production capacity .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
The first contradiction is that some groups and individuals may exploit their resource advantages , previously acquired under the traditional system , to pursue gains under market conditions , thereby forming exclusive , speculative , and closed benefit-distribution groups whose resource-monopoly capability will undermine a balanced interest-differentiation process based on the normal development of the market economy .  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .  
We are willing to make joint efforts with Vietnamese comrades to develop better the relations between the two parties on the basis of independence , absolute equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in each other 's internal affairs ; smoothly promote the two countries ' traditional friendly cooperative relations to a higher level ; and blaze a more beautiful future for the two countries ' relations in the 21st century .  
The Chinese Government and people treasure very much the traditional friendship between China and Laos , and are willing to join the Lao side in conscientiously implementing the " Joint Statement " on bilateral cooperation and in actively deepening and developing the long-term , stable , good neighborly and friendly relations of mutual trust and comprehensive cooperation between China and Laos in the new century .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that China and Syria are both developing countries ; the Chinese Government values its traditional friendship with Syria and appreciates and thanks the Syrian Government for its enduring valuable support for China on the Taiwan and human rights issues ; it is ready to continue to maintain and strengthen coordination and cooperation with Syria in all fields in the new century , and raise to a new level the enduringly stable bilateral relationship of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation .  
Even though in the case of a joint combat battlefield centering around ground forces the traditional one-dimensional support model for covering the entire in-depth battlefield may still ensure combat needs , with the unprecedented rapid development of multidimensional space in the joint combat battlefields of the future , only through the comprehensive utilization of a variety of support methods in multidimensional space will it be possible to ensure the demand of combat operations for logistical support .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
Third , the implementation of the strategy for relying on science and education in national development and the adoption of relevant favorable policies will encourage overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin to make investment in running high-tech and new technology enterprises or transforming the traditional industries with high and new technologies .  This will also provide great opportunities for scientists and technology experts among overseas Chinese and the high-tech enterprises run by them to bring their strong points into better play .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
At the same time , the treaty is imbued with the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally acknowledged norms of international law , and makes a contribution to traditional international legal principles that history has proven effective , such as national sovereignty , equality between states , and noninterference in internal affairs .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
Since , however , Britain has consistently been a loyal follower of US foreign policy , and has consistently acted as an irreplaceable bridge between the United States and Europe , given the marked decline in its national strength , if Britain wants to maintain its great power status and continue to have major influence in the international arena , it will do everything possible to avoid damaging its traditional special relationship with the United States on account of the differences between them .  
Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .  The potential for higher labor productivity driven by technological revolution will not be reversed .  This is why the performance of the " Dow Jones index , " dominated by traditional industries , betters that of the " Nasdaq index . "  
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation demanded that increasing export by every possible means should be regarded as a top priority in the development of China 's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the second half of this year , and that it is necessary to promote the export of mechanical and electrical products , textiles , and other traditional staple commodities and the export of new hi-tech products and agricultural products , and give impetus to export by major exporters and foreign-invested enterprises .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
In view of this , we should select a number of key areas , such as equipment manufacturing , the deep-processing of farm products , clean coal , and the comprehensive utilization of resources ; speed up the development of common technologies , key technologies , and supporting technologies that can give an impetus to structural upgrading ; and accelerate the technical upgrading of traditional industries .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
During the current visit , the NAV delegation has specially studied China 's construction of the Three Gorges Project and held discussions and exchanged views with the NPC financial and economic committee , the State Council 's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee , the Ministry of Water Resources and the Power Corporation . We are willing to carry out active exchanges and cooperation with our Vietnamese comrades in economic construction and to further and constantly enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
We are making further efforts to strengthen foreign trade , taking even more flexible measures by reference to preferential policies in free trade zones , and lifting the control over and invigorating in an organized manner the markets of traditional trade with adjacent countries to intensify efforts in opening along the border .  
He said that China 's entry into the WTO will pose a stern challenge to its traditional agriculture .  If no prompt counter measures are taken in rural areas , he continued , the consequence would be grave .  He stressed the need to take it as " the most important of the important tasks " in rural areas today to meet the challenge in connection with China 's entry into the WTO .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .

These devious fallacies of fundamental knowledge " preached by Li Hongzhi have taken advantage of the bad phenomenon of people 's hatred for society and their pursuit of livelihood and morality in the good expectations and proper ideological trends of truthfulness , benevolence , and forbearance .  They have taken advantage of the indiscriminate mentality and blind faith of some people in traditional thought culture .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
NPC Chairman Li Peng expressed his gratitude for the invitation and the hospitality extended by the Slovak National Council and Government . He said : My wife and I had a chance to visit your country 15 years ago and we are very happy to have the opportunity to come again .  There exists traditional friendship between the Chinese and Slovak peoples and such friendship has been maintained and developed following Slovakia 's independence .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
adhere to the principles of " making the past serve the present , " " making foreign things serve China , " and " weeding through the old to bring forth the new , " actively inherit and carry forward outstanding traditional cultures , study hard , absorb , and use as reference outstanding foreign cultures while resisting all corrupt and decadent ideas and cultures of the exploiting class and opposing the " Westernization " and " division " schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad .  
Kok said the excellent mutually-beneficial cooperative relations between the Netherlands and China have not only realized in the traditional economic and trade relations but also expanded to science , technology , environmental protection , agriculture , water conservancy , port construction , and to others .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
The following policies have been formulated to promote the development of the software and integrated circuit [ IC ] industries in our country ; strengthen the information technology [ IT ] industry 's capacity for innovation and international competitiveness ; spur on the transformation of traditional industries and promote product upgrading and new-generation products ; and further promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy :  
The Xinhua website is composed of websites sponsored by Xinhua News Agency , eight Chinese and foreign language websites under Xinhua , websites operated by 12 magazines affiliated to Xinhua , and 35 local Xinhua divisions and branches .  Each day , the new website will transmits in real time news reports in simplified and traditional Chinese , English , French , Spanish , Russian , Arab , and Japanese with a total wordage of over one million .  The maximum daily visits to the old website exceeded 10 million .  
He said Belarus and China have consistently supported each other and the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries has a deep and solid foundation .  Therefore , there are broad prospects for developing comprehensive friendly cooperation , especially in trade and mutually beneficial economic cooperation in the new century .  
As an important component part of traditional outstanding Tibetan culture , the Tibetan language has been widely studied , extensively used , and greatly developed thanks to the high degree of importance attached to it and the effective protection given by the central government and local government in Tibet .  
With the development of the socialist market economy and the deepening reform of the grain circulation system in our country , however , the traditional central grain reserves management system and operating mechanism obviously lagged behind , its functions were not separated from those of the government , its responsibilities were not clearly defined , and its other problems such as low efficiency and rigid management were conspicuous .  These problems adversely affected the security of grain reserves .  
As for the orientation of industrial development , according to relevant sources , in the next five years , China will focus efforts on developing high-efficiency and high-quality agriculture and quickening the development of high and new technology industries , including the information industry , biological engineering , new energy sources , and new materials .  The traditional industries will be equipped with high technology .  The manufacturing and machine-building industries will be regenerated , and tertiary industry will also be developed actively .  
Jamyang stated : " Only by developing the economy in the areas inhabited by the Tibetan nationality and improving the livelihood of the people of the Tibetan nationality will we be able to better maintain the cultural heritage of the Tibetan nationality or protect the freedom of religious belief or otherwise the culture or traditional religion of the Tibetan nationality would become exhibits only to be ' admired ' by others and would gradually wane .

Simple dishes served for breakfast included such items as soy preserved turnip roots , preserved bean curd , pickled vegetables , salted duck eggs and gluten . Today , because of rapid economic progress and higher incomes , such items as baby shrimps , cuttlefish , pork and dried mushrooms are added to the traditional breakfast meal of congee .  
Now , it is recognized as Kuo Chu or national drama , since it is a genuine Chinese art form which upholds traditional virtues such as loyalty , filial piety , chastity , justice and righteousness . No matter what its name , however , there is no doubt that strenuous efforts must be made to save this ancient art from extinction . The biggest reason for the decline of Peiping opera is the fact that its classical language is difficult for members of the younger generation to understand .  
Pointing to the Republic of China 's attractive investment climate , Chen Fei-lung , chairman of Nan Chao Chemical Industries commented , " Over the last 30 years , Taiwan has had a very stable and secure government . There is a highly skilled and educated work force , and with the traditional cultural and ethical background , this makes for harmonious labor relations . Worker productivity also surpasses that in many Southeast Asian nations . These are all factors that attract Overseas Chinese investment . "  
As a result , I discovered , as we rehearsed , that they had made a lot of progress . " The combined performances of the 10 dancers who took part in the 1982 Arts Festival provided a rare opportunity to observe the current level of Chinese dance , and how naturally traditional culture and modern dance training have been combined in a free environment to create a base for its development .  
After FM stations were established in Taiwan , improving musical quality and boosting broadcasting standards , radio began featuring a wide variety of music - - classical , pop , Chinese opera , folk and traditional songs .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
This bustling hub is not only one of the island 's most prosperous industrial centers but is also rich in history and traditional Chinese arts and crafts . Taichung is a unique blend of old and new , offering the visitor an example of Taiwan 's economic development and a glimpse of its cultural heritage .  
Han Pao-te , chief architect of the project , stressed that the idea of the center is to give young people of today a chance to experience what daily life in the world of their ancestors was like . Sung Shih-hsuan , director of the China Youth Corps , added that hopefully the traditional architecture will help the youth of today better understand their roots and thus inspire them to seek a greater interest in traditional ideals . The complex is located at the southern end of the Hengch'un peninsula within the designated K'enting National Park area .  
Architecturally the buildings are in the traditional style with elegant swallowtail roofs , red pillar supports and delicate latticework window screens . While the buildings were constructed with painstaking attention to traditional detail , the designers have also managed to include all the most modern conveniences . Every building has an air conditioning system , telephone and announcing system and hot running water .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
Tales of the faithful dog rescuing his master abound in the traditional folklore of ancient China . Dogs have also served man in the art of war and defense . Throughout history , select breeds have been trained to attack , defend , carry messages and transport supplies . This special military role continues today .  
Three years ago popular box fans began to replace the traditional round models . Innovative colored plastic fans which could be purchased for half the price of previous electric fans became widespread .  
Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
Attired in new outfits , young and old , servant and master enjoy the festive activities . Red , the symbolic color of good fortune is in evidence everywhere , whether as part of the main dress or as a colorful embellishment such as a sash or shoe . A peek inside the rooms of the house reveal a host of activities and traditional customs .  
The Taoist ideal of being one with nature , escaping the confines of daily life to a solitary existence among the forests and mountains has long played an important part in the general appreciation and popularity of traditional landscape painting . But long before this artistic appreciation became prominent , the natural forms of the mountain and the river were held in great esteem by the early Chinese . The ancient Chinese had a deep interest in the mystic form of mountains .  
The traditional garden is a realm of contrasts . The sheer hardness of rock is set against the soft ripples of the flowing brook . The light of the sun is accentuated by the darkness of shadows . Heights seem to become taller and empty space filled .  
Below the stage stand a crowd of older people , chewing on betel nuts . These patrons of puppet theatre are joined by the four puppet troupes left in Taiwan , who abandon their traditional competitive stance to come together and view the play . Professors and others concerned about the future of folk art as well as reporters and photographers with flash cameras are on the scene .  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
In these photographs Huang 's purpose is to record in brilliant color the special character of the cultures in the fast-changing remote areas on the island . By employing , as he says , " the human touch , " he is able to capture the naturalness , warmth , and ingenuousness of his subjects . In shooting them , he adheres to a traditional , classical style of realistic photography .  
Work on the plan , supported by a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development , got under way in July 1984 and is expected to take six years to complete . The ultimate goal is to store the complete text of China 's 25 traditional dynastic histories , around 60 million Chinese characters , onto one thin computer disk , enabling researchers to search , index , and analyze the material by software commands .  
May you grow old together " is a traditional good-luck wish for newlyweds . However , according to historians , the chances of that wish coming true were mighty slim in days past . Life expectancy in the Chou dynasty 2,600 years ago was eighteen . In the Han it was a mere 22 , and even as late as 260 years ago , in the Ching dynasty , it was only 28 .  
According to Wang Ming-yang , a lecturer in industrial engineering at National Tsing Hua University , the problem lies in mass production . In a traditional society , where products were made by hand , clothing and everyday items could be custom designed to fit the individual .  
Funafuti , the largest island and the site of the capital , has only one road , which runs around the island . The road is paved with stone and lined with coconut and banana trees , whose broad , close leaves , brimming with a rich , tropical exuberance , obscure the view of the traditional grass huts behind .  
Also , it 's easy to meet people who have lived overseas . The patterned cloth which the man in the picture has wrapped around his waist is called a sulu and belongs to the Tuvaluans ' traditional costume , but on top he 's wearing a modern T-shirt from Nauru .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
The most sought-after qualities for the traditional Taiwanese opera are a beautiful and intricate voice , figure , and acting skill . To accommodate the television medium , with its fast and furious pace , much of the complex vocals and acting have been cut out . It 's unavoidable that the original flavor of the operas is lost .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention . These newly planned community districts and zones will spring up everywhere and improve the quality of everyday existence . New edifices will include traditional Chinese architectural features , and space for outdoor activities will also be provided for the members of each community , such as playgrounds , parks , and gardens .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
In view of the greater access to improved modes of travel , the Tourism Bureau intends to transform the Yueh-mei Farm in Taichung County into an amusement complex with varied functions . The complex is designed to reflect traditional Chinese culture and yet present the natural sciences and modern science and technology . The Bureau will also promote private investment in tourist hotels and recreational facilities in the area .  
Generally speaking , the classical and traditional performing arts are most popular with businessmen . Avant-garde and experimental art is not what they 're after , " Yin points out . Large American and European corporations usually support symphony orchestras and ballet companies , and businessmen in Japan are even more conservative : They consider the firm 's reputation their lifeblood and are even less willing to tie the corporate image to a newcomer .  
He composed poems and antithetical couplets in impeccable classical Chinese , disdaining the vernacular and even the modern innovation of punctuation . He married a Chinese and hobnobbed with such cultural luminaries as Ch'i Pai-shih and Shen Yin-mo , filling his leisure hours with the traditional pursuits of a Chinese literatus : the lute , the game of go , calligraphy , and painting .  
Orchid Island is located about 49 nautical miles east of the city of Taitung . With education relatively late and travel inconvenient , much traditional culture and thinking is preserved .  
Chou Mi-mi director of the Revival Youth Yueh Drama Troupe , explains that the performance style of Yueh drama incorporates the best elements of Peking opera , spoken drama and folk opera . With attractive melodies and an easy to understand vernacular text , it is ideal for people of all ages and well worth preserving as a valuable example of regional opera . " I hope that the government will do more to extend a helping hand to traditional folk opera and so keep its legacy alive , " says enthusiastic proponent Chou Mi-mi . (  
Sharon Liu ( owner of the Colorful Farmer Co . , 35 , divorced , with two children ) I 've always been pretty traditional in my thinking . I was a typical " bride-to-be student " in junior college . I always thought that a woman 's place was in the home , and I wanted to be a good wife and parent just like my mother , so after I married I quit my job and concentrated on being a housewife .  
The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
On the tangible side , we must begin by changing modern domestic architecture . Builders should adopt the spirit of the traditional courtyard house and design residential developments that meet the needs of small families yet reflect the spirit of the extended family home .  
Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily . In addition to this the condescension of Western and Japanese scholars stirred up an intellectual " war to defend culture , " which involved working hard to glorify the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
Facelift for a Venerable Career - - Taiwan 's Changing Civil Service " Ten years obscurely spent in studious poverty / Are crowned , th'examination pass 'd , with vast celebrity . " In traditional China , where learned scholarship was always regarded as the noblest vocation , to become a government official was every scholar 's highest ideal .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
As I practiced across Asia I also found that traditional treatments such as acupuncture , herbal remedies and tonic foods usually stemmed from Chinese herbal medicine , and so I thought of researching into Chineseme dicine . " In 1967 in New York Dr . Tsuei happened to meet the eminent herbal doctor Cheng Man-ch'ing , and began studying the Chinese medical work known as the Internal Classic with him . "  
In traditional Chinese ghost stories the principal character is often a fetchingly lovely female ghost . This no doubt heightens the tension of the story , but there is also a good reason behind it - - unmarried women who die young have no male progeny to carry out ancestral worship within their spouse 's family , neither can they be accommodated in their own family 's ancestral spirit tablet , which means their fate is more liable than most to be that of a wandering ghost .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
As chief architect of the temple 's reconstruction , the late artist Li Mei-shu engaged Taiwan 's best temple builders and craftsmen in wood and stone carving in order to leave to posterity a fine cultural heritage of traditional architectural art . " Cheng Yu-ts'ai adds that many foreigners , particularly Japanese , make special journeys to see this " temple of oriental art . "  
On stage there looked to be the customary singing , gestures , recitation , combat and orchestral accompaniment to each scene ; but the costume designs were anything but traditional , attempting to convey a subdued texture through orange and black materials . In another departure from traditional Peking opera the actors no longer wore their traditional maquillage , and dispensed with customary accessories such as sleeve drapes and artificial beards .  
Although only a few remain , the trees are still the garden 's " registered trademark . " The eight virtues of its name refer to the traditional " seven virtues of the persimmon " - - long life , lots of shade , no birds ' nests , no insects , leaves that look lovely in the frost , a treat for visitors , and big , plump fallen leaves that are nice to draw - - plus an addition of his own : the leaves can cure stomachache when fried in water .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
Among the traditional yi-chen , some which have particularly compelling singing , genuine religious significance , or functions of bonding people orbuilding healthier bodies , have been promoted in primary and middle schools . For example , the Sung Chiang chen , which stresses unity , and the Cart Drum chen , with its athletic movements , are both being passed on in a number of schools .  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
Their coach , physical education professor Wu Teng-ta tells us : " The props for drum dancing are quite simple ; cymbals are all you need for backup accompaniment . Also the movements are lively and beautifully patterned , making this kind of dance perfect for high school and primary school students learning traditional folk dances . " The students of Taitung Normal College can take elective courses in drum dancing , so that some day they may pass along the art to their own students .  
Classical neo - - Mannerist architecture favors round pillars and gables , and the external walls are mostly decorated with white false stone ; it is relatively stately . Non-classical neo-Mannerist architecture includes Byzantine-style or the North European traditional brick construction ; the outside is relatively complex , luxurious , and free-wheeling .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season . "  
" Chinese food is world famous for its fine flavor , and modernizing traditional cuisine is something we can work toward , " says Jamin Wang , who feels that frozen food is a trend of the times . If Chinese people , who hold great stock in the " culture of eating , " can add a Chinese touch to the trend , then maybe frozen food wo n't just be quick and convenient anymore , but delicious ! ( Wei Hung-chin / photos by Diago Chiu / tr . by Peter Eberly )  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
On the software side , going into a modern theater meant the plot had to be tight and polished , not like the traditional outdoor stage with just a broad idea and the content left to the actors ' emotions to elaborate .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
The midterm and final report cards they handed over were Komalan Opera , a Taiwanese opera that tells the story of how the Han Chinese and the Pingpu aborigines a century ago changed from opposition to mutual acceptance , and Walking Theater , a stage play that centers around the life of a veteran Pei Kuan opera performer and thus contains a large amount of traditional singing , reciting and acting .  
Much as he loves traditional outdoor theater , he is planning appropriate ways to educate audiences intheater-going : by setting up a circus tent , for instance , and charging a fee for refreshments , so that audiences will treat the theater as something more special than they had in the past . At the same time that he is busy forming the new company , Yu continues to engage in field work , searching for veteran artists and arranging for joint performances and master classes .  
Besides the hardware and shape , traditional ho-yuan also extolled a natural , layered and shifting spacial notion . Could this be applied in a vital , living way to modern architecture ?  
Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
For example , hsiang-chu singing copies after Peking Opera , with the tone high pitched and clear , using falsetto , with the same styles for the leading man and leading lady . The gestures and choreography are also more pronounced and defined . The music is performed according to fixed charts , which is quite different from the traditional Taiwanese ko-tzai-hsi where " the teacher gives the root , the actors improvise the branches " - - the actors on the stage and the musicians backstage play off and coor-dinate with each other .  
Country feeling in the city : At the 1990 Taipei Lantern Festival sponsored by the Tourism Bureau , the sculptor Yang Ying-feng used science and technology to add to the festive atmosphere by creating a giant stainless steel dragon that featured music , dry ice and a changing laser light show . The traditional lanterns at Lung Shan Temple in the city 's Wanhua district likewise attracted thousands of visitors .  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Candidate , candidate . . . , incompetent , incompetent . . . , fall off the horse when you try to ride . . . . " From its origins as a game in which children rode on a stick horse , the puma troupe has gone from the traditional imperial examination candidate riding a red horse following a deity around to today 's riding of a white horse being sent along with the deceased to ride the clouds . This extreme development of riding with abandon through heaven and hell is a major transformation in yi-chen .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
Professor Yang Ling-ling of the Taipei Medical College points out that Chinese are in the habit of taking composite medications rather carelessly In particular there are many so-called " informal recipes " for Chinese traditional remedies that include diuretic ingredients which are potentially toxic . Diuretics can create a false impression of increased urine flow , which can make uremia sufferers careless , when in fact they may be extending the illness and even worsening the damage to the kidneys . "  
Besides the merely religious activities of praying for good fortune , the temple has celebrations linked to the season . From Chinese New Year 's to the Sea Goddess ' birthday in March , there is a continuous stream of activities , including classical dances to welcome the God of Happiness and ceremonies welcoming Matsu as well as such traditional farming and fishing activities as the dying of fish nets , chanting to count fish fry , walking the water wheel , grabbing chickens and floating on bamboo rafts to grab ducks .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
Today , succeeding to traditional tea houses , with modern beverage and packaging technology , it has finally broken through the traditional image of " old man tea " - of elderly gents sipping delicate little cups of hot tea - to display a startling potential for rebirth .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
But with Taiwan 's soaring property prices and the headlong rush of urban development , can these old town houses , draped over Tanshui 's undulating topography on the traditional long rectangular plots so typical of this province , survive ? Some say yes , some no ; as yet we can not be sure .  
If you want to understand traditional Yami culture , you have to get back to the tribal village . Only through such everyday experiences as building Yami boats and going out at night to catch flying fish will one come to an intuitive understanding of the deep meaning behind related legends , taboos and customs . ( photo by Cheng Yuan-ching )  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men . Not even a TV series which exalts the most legendary female figure in Chinese history can escape the confines of maleoriented thinking .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
Choose any public structure in the Po Ai Special District ( the high-security area which includes the offices of top government officials ) and you may be surprised to discover that this structure has , at one and the same time , pillars and gables in the traditional Italian style , an exaggerated French Mansard style roof , and red brick walls made with decorative white stripes typical of Britain 's Victorian era .  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
The magic is in the detailChen has travelled all over Taiwan and southern Fujian looking at traditional buildings , but his favorite is Chaihsing Villa in Tantsu Rural Township , Taichung County . Its carved wood , chiachishao ( decorative lead-glaze ceramics ) and carved brick-clay tiles are all superb .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
The most marked characteristic of traditional Bunun garb is the pocket-like pouch worn at the chest by Bunun men , called a kulin . Men 's clothes feature colored patterns on a white background , with the main patterns being on the back , whereas women 's clothes are mainly black . According to custom , Bunun women can not wear brightly colored clothing because of their " original sin . "  
There is greater flexibility in the forward progress of the experimental classes . Teachers can design instructional activities to meet the needs of the curriculum . For example , in the Chinese language class on " Kung Jung Takes the Smallest Pear , " the teacher got the kids to put on a little drama . For a third year lesson in the standardized texts on the aboriginal " Harvest Festival , " the Tatun Primary School invited the Formosan Aboriginal Dance Troupe to perform traditional indigenous song and dance at the school .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Community chief Tseng Chen-chuan describes how in the past , when village elders were happily drunk , they would sing a traditional ballad recounting tribal history , the gist of which was : " Our ancestors were born from the rocks , and came here from their place of origin on the other side of Tapachien Mountain . Ssumakussu was the first place they made home on the north side of the mountain , and when the population of the tribe increased they branched out to Hsiuluan , Tienpu , Hsinkuang and elsewhere . "  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Lin undertook a simple ritual gesture designed to break the spell ( he placed some water in a bowl and upended it on a small table under the traditional " double joy " character suspended on the wall ) , and everything was fine .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
The first time that I had written and delivered a speech in Mandarin . The first time that I had attended a Christian church service conducted entirely in Mandarin . The first time that I had celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Taoyuan complete with hot pot ( huo guo ) , sticky rice cake ( nian gao ) , and a lucky red envelope ( hong bao ) . The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
One of his own specialties is a " galan-tine , " in which many strips of meat are bound together into a long loaf . To stew the meat , instead of the traditional sachet of strong spices , Kao only uses a few pods of star anise and a dash of Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper . To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
Another traditional veggie offering is the " Arhat Dish " ( arhats are disciples of Buddha ) , which is made up of a number of ingredients blended together . These may include sliced mushroom , miniature corn , carrots , gingko and gingko nuts , lily bulbs , or facai seaweed . These are fried up separately , then combined and cooked again evenly , and seasoned .  
Yet , Kan emphasizes , not all men are " genderblind . " Many men are willing to imagine themselves in the woman 's shoes . Moreover , not all women have an inborn " feminist consciousness . " Take for example many women who come from affluent families or who have been very successful and have a vested interest in this male-dominated society ; or look at women from traditional backgrounds who have long accepted as fate that " males are to be respected and women despised " and who have never dared voice any doubts .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
Even though the hunting way of life practiced by the aboriginal people for centuries is being turned into an economic resource , it need not-and should not-be merely a superficial tourist attraction . Of course the hunting plan can not solve all existing problems , but , says Sasala , aboriginal people do n't always want to be complaining and asking for government help . Nor should they be intimidated by existing laws into readily giving up their traditional way of life . The hunting plan is actually a movement on behalf of all of aboriginal society .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] . The almanac showed outstanding calculating capability , being comparable to the official version , published shortly after Hong 's , in defining the traditional 24 " solar periods " ( climatic stages of the year ) . Hong 's work was very well-received .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
The way this mainland wife was accepted by a traditional Taiwanese clan and has become chairperson of the management committee of their ancestral home , can be attributed not only to her seniority , unbending principles and utter selflessness , but also to her matchless warmhearted enthusiasm and indomitable fighting spirit .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
In 1997 , after the new curricula for elementary schools had been fully implemented , Chung Ching , an assistant professor of math education at National Taipei Teachers ' College wrote in a report he made on " The Transformation of the Culture of Math Class in the Lower Grades " that those students who have been educated under the new curricula are much more " able to voice their opinions , ask questions , work with others and learn from others ' way of thinking " than earlier students who had received traditional educations .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
This is especially significant in view of the wholesale destruction of traditional buildings in mainland China over recent years . In Taiwan too , tall office buildings and concrete apartment blocks have become the main architectural " vocabulary , " leaving no space for stone lions , and the stone lions at temples are often smeared in gaudy colors , making them unbearably vulgar .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life . It appears in the traditional Chinese list of " essential items " for the kitchen , right up there with rice , soy sauce , oil , firewood , salt and vinegar . The late Lin Yutang described it as " a widespread custom that has added much color to everyday life of the people . "  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
In an ordinary class there are too many students to do any activities , and you 're stuck with traditional teaching methods . In order to keep things moving along , it is n't possible to look after the needs of students who fall behind . But in the experimental class , students are divided into four groups according to ability , with no more than eight students in each group . Every student has a chance to speak , and students of different abilities can be brought along at their own pace , and not abandoned .  
Lee has been steeped all his life in traditional Chinese morality , and has always sought to inject his personal ideas into his movies , " teaching a moral lesson in a fun way , " as the old Chinese saying goes . Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
As Hong Liren continues to reminisce , sometimes wistfully and sometimes with excitement , the afternoon passes by and evening approaches . With the sun still shining brightly into the studio , musicians begin to drift in . To either side the players of the pipa ( a plucked string instrument , similar to the ancient Chinese lute ) , sanxian ( a three-stringed plucked instrument ) , dongxiao ( a vertical bamboo flute ) and erxian ( a two-stringed bowed instrument ) are seated on traditional wooden armchairs .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . G-Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time . He is very fearful of failing to record tribal elders before they die , thereby losing a precious part of the tribal cultural heritage .  
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits . Critic Wang Chia-chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "  
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .  
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time-honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth . Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers . The three-legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
They express their opinions and get to know each other . The online authors that publishing companies are focusing on are but a tiny fraction of the online population . What is more , even a cursory search of the Web will bring up hundreds of websites devoted to online literature . The body of literature represented therein is both vast and varied in format , and only a tiny bit of it can be reflected in the output of traditional publishers .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Every traditional culture in the world has magic amulets ( geometric shapes , bones , insects or animals ) that bring good luck , ward off evil , or affect the physical or mental condition of other people , or that even , with the appropriate incantations , put you online to the supernatural world .  
The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Wu Cheng-chun , general manager of the LungYen Group , explains that his company 's funeral service is organized around a simple system , in contrast to the convoluted requirements of a traditional funeral . All the essential rites are included , but not the various bizarre and superfluous additions that are often seen .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
The first leg of reform ( " changing opera " ) included a ban on traditional operatic works that dealt in any way with frightening murders , superstitious beliefs in ghosts or spirits , or sexually risque subject matter .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Chu Ge noted that he strongly encouraged Lee to use the traditional Chinese medium of ink , because ink by nature is best suited to express abstract ideas . Lee , having never before painted a traditional ink painting , has proved even more capable than most of transcending concrete forms to let the ink freely play out in a way that characterizes his most recent series of compositions , " Language of Ink . "  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
The Danaiku Ecological Park was established in 1995 , and in 1996 its revenues totaled only NT $ 839,000 . The following year they more than doubled to nearly NT $ 2 million . This rapid growth continued in the years that followed , and the figure topped NT $ 10 million in 2001 . Currently there are nearly 80 village residents employed there as guides , plant tenders or sellers of souvenirs , traditional Tsou food or barbecued meat .  
When Kao was a youngster he dreamed of running like Pasuya , a figure in Tsou myth that could run as fast as a sparrow flies . Kao had learned the story from his father . " I worshipped my father , who had received traditional tribal training as a hunter ! "  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
Ho Chun-jui , head of the Center for the Study of Sexualities at National Central University , analyzes the movie in terms of time , place and people thus : The gradual legitimization of homosexuality in Taiwanese culture has lessened the taboo against Lan Yu ; the two cool male protaganists not only show passion and warmth , but also pointedly express intimate tenderness , a breakthrough in the portrayal of the traditional male lead ; and the contradiction between love vs class background and tradition-told without leaving the parameters of a love story-all naturally please the audience .  
Kwan is talented at conveying the role of the tormented but strong-willed female in traditional society . Considered as particularly skilled at smashing the stereotyped female image as portrayed in cinema , he possesses a strong sense of feminism .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
Tunghai University 's architecture team , the group responsible for the design , after discussing with structural engineers utilized a " sandwich " technique to build the walls . The walls ' outward appearance preserves tradition in its use of stone slabs from 40 to 50 centimeters thick . However , the interior of the walls is made of steel-reinforced concrete , allowing them to satisfy structural safety requirements in addition to displaying traditional features .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
When you visit Kinmen , everywhere you can see old villages with their houses neatly lined up on a north-south axis . Civilian residences preserving traditional Fujianese architecture form tight little knots . Red tiles , stone walls , and elegant " swallow-tail " roof ridges bounce sunlight off the fresh green fields , creating a leisurely ambience of small-island warmth and security .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
Natives of Hsiyu living on the main island of Taiwan and elsewhere are now starting to move back , attracted by the outstanding traditional homes , friendly atmosphere , big expanse of azure skies , and pristine blue sea .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
In the early evening hours on the annual Lantern Festival , the residents of Erhkan Village light up long strings of red lanterns and feast on all sorts of traditional Lantern Festival treats , such as chicken noodle soup in an herbal medicine broth , steamed pumpkin dumplings , slices of cobia sashimi , peanut candy , and deep-fried jujubes .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
In 1992 , an international conference of members of the World Heritage Convention held in Japan produced the " Nara Document on Authenticity . " This declared that Japan 's maintenance and replacement of wooden structures help preserve traditional skills , so that the previous definition of authenticity was expanded to include " reliability of the sources of relevant information . "  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
His boss 's faith in his talents proved well founded , as Huang quickly injected wonderful creative touches to the small traditional ornaments that he carved . The proportions , expressions , and poses of his rendered subjects were always accurate , detailed , and lively , and never fell into the typical ruts . As a result , his boss began to let him design new products . Huang began to acquire a small reputation within the industry .  
Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
In the sixth lunar month , traditional music and theater troupes from across Taiwan make their festive way through an outdoor market in Lukang with " birthday noodles " and " birthday peaches , " screeching away on their high-pitched suona ( a traditional Chinese wind instrument ) and beating on gongs and drums as they head toward Yuchu Temple , located in the middle of an old outdoor market . They come here to pay their respects to Marshal Tiandu , honored by many thespians in Taiwan as their patron god .  
In the visual media kingdom of the US , in the past few years revenue from productions that include animation and digital special effects has exceeded that from films shot frame by frame on celluloid in the traditional manner , and in Japan , computer games outstrip the automobile industry in sales value , showing remarkable popularity despite the stagnant economy .  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
Recently , various large hospitals have bowed to popular trends and are providing traditional therapeutic massage as an immensely successful " sideline . " Does this perhaps reflect an urgent need for stress-free tender loving care ?  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
A returnee to Taiwan after 20 years in Spain , where she rose to international fame as a flamenco dancer , Flor de Loto sports a deep tan and gregarious personality . There is a flamboyance about her , but not an intimidating sort . On the contrary , she has a way of putting absolutely everyone at ease , as if she were the nice lady next door . With ease and grace , she manages to combine the hearty , unrestrained spirit of the Spaniards with the traditional virtues of the Chinese .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
But " back when traditional filial piety was the only model for intergenerational relations , there were also many problems , " argues Chuang Hui-chiu . In the past , everyone held an idealized version of home . When social change exposed problems to the light of day , people started talking about them . This discussion is healthy .  
Yeh Kuang-hui , an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , has researched traditional Chinese conceptions of filial piety . He points out that the result of such social precepts as " parents can do no wrong " and " there are three major offenses against filial piety , and the gravest of all is not producing an heir " is an autocratic family . It offers a kind of " absolute " or compulsory filial piety that no longer holds water .  
Yeh points out that ever since the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , the traditional principle of filial piety was deemed to be dogmatism . The principle of filial piety was connected to loyalty to the emperor and was thus authoritarian . In modern society , everybody is an independent individual , and so today we talk about relative filial piety .  
Yu Xiulian 's suspicions that Yu Jiaolong is the individual responsible for the sword 's theft strain her friendship with the younger woman , as well as dragging Li and Jade Fox into bloody conflict . Crouching Tiger leads audiences on a ride through the panoply of Chinese scenery , from endless stretches of barren desert to misty mountain landscapes to verdant bamboo forests to cascading waterfalls to traditional courtyards .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
This year marked a special innovation for Pinghsi 's Sky Lantern Festival , as Western Valentine 's Day fell between the Lord of Heaven celebration on the ninth day of the first lunar month and the traditional Lantern Festival on the fifteenth . Pinghsi expanded its Sky Lantern Festival into a carnival embracing all three .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
Apart from raising tinsmithing to the realm of art , he has been constantly tinkering , improving the properties of tin to make it stronger and harder , to allow it to keep its luster longer , and to give it a silky feel . He has also employed traditional casting , cold forging and detailed carving to expand its expressive abilities .  
Clad in bright red traditional aboriginal garb , the Piyahaw 's Piyahaw Dance Troupe danced energetically to a song by aboriginal singer Wan Sha-lang , their gestures expansive and full of confidence , looking for all the world as if they had many years of dancing experience under their belts . " When we were just starting out , we had stage fright , " admits Wang Shu-min , the troupe leader . But now , little more than a year later , they have already played at many performance spaces and are very relaxed when they perform .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs . After grasping the unique qualities of eggs , he pushed his skill to a new level by nesting a set of eight different sized eggs each within the other resulting in what looked like the traditional multi-layered balls carved from elephant ivory . He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Wu Tsai-chu was born in Miaoli in 1938 into a family that was wealthy but also extremely strict . Although her father Wu A-tsai was a businessman , he was also a firm believer in the traditional code of behavior and ethics . He had a total of nine children and inflicted corporal punishment for any behavior that displeased him .  
The folk totems in the painstakingly executed works of potter Li Hsing-lung rearrange traditional linear patterns , transforming them into symbols , resulting in entirely new creations uniquely representative of the culture from which they sprang . Bearing gold , red , blue , and indigo colors typical of Eastern art , Li 's works are redolent of the Orient , and of Taiwan in particular .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
His objective was to achieve a new kind of texture and break with the norms of traditional lacquered pottery . Artists before Li simply took pottery as the base for the lacquer , while Li sought to preserve the linear patterns and texture of pottery along with the " layered light " effect of lacquer right on the surface of the finished work , thereby adding to its visual impact and achieving a melding of these two millennia-old art forms and blazing a new trail in the arts .  
The eldest grandson of Chang Wei-ting , the European representative of the ROC Tourism Bureau , was especially noteworthy for his personification of the traditional Chinese virtues of hard work and patience . He continued to practice , despite blisters , cuts , and torn skin , achieving amazing results in six days , and his skillful demonstration of the staff won resounding applause .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
A sound recycling regime is extremely important . " Chen gives an example : Taiwan 's paper recycling is quite successful , because traditional paper recycling businesses have existed for 30 or 40 years . They have not been displaced by societal changes , and have been fortunate to have their efforts be in lockstep with the new era of resource recycling . A virtuous circle has been created , not only making for an outstanding record with recycling , but also seeing vendors evolve from the use of street stalls to the construction of numerous recycling plants .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Wu had made separate molds for the orchids ' centers and five petals , so he invited an expert in " running water " welding to put them together . After six hours , the petals were only halfway assembled . The expert said that he really thought they should use traditional welding flux , but Wu Ching was determined and refused . After the expert left , Wu worked and studied for five hours before finally finishing one orchid .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
The redbrick building was in traditional Hokkien style , and the light reflecting off the lake set the whole scene off . The lake was surrounded on all sides by smaller ponds full of aquatic plants ; grasses of different heights , lotuses swaying gently-a wonderfully relaxing scene , like something from another world .  
Holes were patched with pieces of broken tile , a mixture of lime and sand was applied as a base , and then a layer made up of a mixture of brown sugar and lime was applied over it . The terrazo and tile floors of the interior and the halls were completely changed out and replaced with traditional unglazed tiles .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
The pavilion on the hill features a carved wood panel ceiling with reliefs of peonies , peaches , plums , orchids , and chrysanthemums . Folding screens and scrolls feature impressive calligraphy . Best of all are several pairs of rhyming couplets around the garden , which were written specifically for their locations . The calligraphy , by an elder Chinese-Australian man , is exquisite , and their wording is steeped in traditional Chinese culture .

The application of the widely advocated concept of good governance with less emphasis on traditional donor assistance is not impartial : it is very flexible and indulgent when it comes to countries with strategic raw materials , but strict and restrictive when it comes to others .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies .

Another programme that previously focused on small-scale , on-farm efforts in the use and conservation of water and soil resources and on traditional dryland crops has recently expanded to also cover off-farm common property resources and the development of viable alternative livelihood systems in marginal rural areas .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations .

several requests for 1995 intakes were received from our traditional co-sponsoring partners , such as the Institute for International Education and others , these represented a small number of many of the worthy proposals both inside South Africa and abroad that could not be given proper consideration in the absence of recommendations on the Programme 's future .  
To form an acceptable transitional government , which could , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account .

" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
Information , education and communication strategies that employ a multi-channel approach have proved effective , since information can be disseminated through various channels , traditional and modern , and can be packaged in various forms so as to allow both literate and illiterate audiences to understand key messages .  
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .

That gesture had a double symbolism , as it expressed the traditional friendship between the Cyprus and Palestinian peoples and constituted a concrete manifestation of the progress in the peace process and of the need for substantial steps to improve the standard of living of the Palestinian people .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
To form an acceptable transitional government which could , inter alia , control the national security force until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Provide accessible , affordable , impartial , prompt and humane local systems of justice by , inter alia , facilitating and strengthening , where appropriate , existing traditional institutions and procedures for the resolution of disputes and conflicts ; ( e bis . )  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
The control of water use in irrigated agriculture can be addressed in various ways , such as levying penalties for water use in excess of water requirements projected for the next growing season , or by promoting the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems to replace the traditional techniques , for example , by making available low-interest loans contingent on the purchase and installation of improved irrigation equipment . 
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
The ECLAC Staff Association is active in a wide variety of issues , ranging from the traditional staff representation activities to support of charitable activities , sports and cultural activities as well as ongoing staff welfare and social functions .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The family unit in India was very strong and provided the social security net for vulnerable family members ; however , the traditional extended or joint family was increasingly being eroded because of the strains of modern life . 
Three aspects were especially relevant : to adapt the institution of the family to modern times while preserving the stabilizing functions of the traditional family ; to emancipate women from traditionally defined roles to enable them to participate as equal partners in public life ; and to control population growth , which was related both to gender justice and to the imperatives of economic development .  
In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
According to the governmental delegates , the State and its legislation , while recognizing the dominant , but not overwhelming , role of the Orthodox Church , which represents the religion of the majority of the population for historical , national and traditional reasons , are said to provide a climate of religious freedom , notwithstanding isolated cases of intolerance or discrimination , in particular in the administration .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
His delegation shared the concern about the dire financial crisis faced by UNRWA and was gratified to note that UNRWA was considering a number of innovative approaches to expand its traditional donor base .  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
The Panel , while considering the merits of the application of bottom-up approaches along with top-down approaches , involving all major groups concerned with the issues , emphasized the need for national action programmes to draw more extensively on local and traditional knowledge and agro-sylvopastoral systems , in accordance with guiding principles as outlined in programme element I . 3 . 
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .  To this end , we express strong support for the steps taken by the Court to take advantage of the benefits provided by the electronic media , such as the Internet , and in particular the construction of its own website , which should facilitate public access to the Court 's voluminous documents .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
The work of UNED-UK / United Nations Environment and Development-United Kingdom Committee and Peoples ' Forum 2001 in Japan have been recognized by other non-governmental organizations and international organizations . 18 National networks , if supported and strengthened , have the potential to be the best-placed mechanisms for follow-up to international conferences . 19 Support for national network non-governmental organizations is particularly important in the next phase of Agenda 21 follow-up , in which international conferences , which have been the traditional mobilizing factor for national networks , will be largely missing . 
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Such measures would promote change in persisting negative attitudes towards children , particularly girls , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , and contribute to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health and well-being of children , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
It was highlighted that education , technical training and lifelong learning were integral parts on a continuum , implying that knowledge and skills acquired in formal as well as non-formal , out-of-school education , community activities and traditional knowledge are valued and recognized . 
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
The Platform for Action defines violence against women as including Physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , including battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry _ related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non _ spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ( para .  113 ) .  
The Committee will continue to receive information relating to traditional practices , particularly in the light of its revised guidelines for reports which require States parties , in preparing their initial and subsequent reports under the articles of the Convention or in supplementary oral and / or written materials supplied in connection with reports already submitted , to take account of the 12 critical areas of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights with men and access to economic resources and to increase the access of women to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
It was reported that , unlike traditional publicly funded projects , in which the Government was responsible for the entire implementation of the project , including for obtaining financing and guaranteeing its repayment , in the case of privately financed infrastructure projects the Government engaged a private entity to develop , maintain and operate an infrastructure facility in exchange for the right to charge a price , either to the public or to the Government , for the use of the facility or the services or goods it generated .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of peace and security , this paramount international body must be equipped and strengthened to do more in framing international treaties and standards and in encouraging international norms and practices that will bring about equitable economic development and social justice for all peoples .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
Given the limited capacity of the judiciary , the lack of knowledge about national legislation among the population , and the lack of resources to make use of the court system , the large majority of the population will in practical terms have their legal status defined within the framework of traditional systems in the foreseeable future .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .

Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .

While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
The reasons for this lack of effective function are many and varied ; common themes include unsupportive policy and institutional framework , a lack of political and community commitment to protection , the alienation of communities from their traditional lands , and lack of capacity associated with the provision of insufficient resources for effective management .  
Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices .

In many places , successive waves of settler migration from the metropolis ( in the case of Hawaii ) or of royal trading companies representatives ( frequent in the East Indies ) , and certain legal modalities ( some highly innovative , such as the perpetual leasing of territories ) emerged alongside the traditional juridical forms ( bilateral agreements and treaties ) .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women .

While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .

It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
The statement indicated that female genital mutilation was considered by a number of societies to be an initiation rite which allowed the girl child to integrate into the community and stressed the importance of training , information and education as effective means to combat harmful traditional practices and noted that judicial decisions should be a last recourse in that context .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .

For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .

In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
UNDP ' s financial assistance to basic education was directed to primary education and alternative programmes , early childhood development , basic education for youth and adults , and education through traditional and modern media and social action .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
HTPs are traditional , cultural and religious practices handed down through succeeding generations which are often detrimental to the health and psychological and social well-being of women and girls .  
Although the dug-out dwellings were not designed as permanent residences and required repair in certain aspects , the preference of the residents to remain in their traditional dwellings near their grazing lands provides a cautionary example of the need not to assume that more sophisticated , not to mention more expensive , structures will necessarily correspond to the needs and preferences of the intended beneficiaries .  
This would include ( i ) documentation of traditional ethnobiological knowledge , including identification of ecosystems , species and genetic types that are endangered or in short supply at the community level ; ( ii ) factors responsible for their endangerment , and actions that can be taken to address the situation ; and ( iii ) identification of knowledgeable persons who should be formally recognized and made integral participants in biodiversity conservation at the national and local levels .  
Tourism is a labour-intensive activity that does not require a high level of specialization , and if well managed and of the proper size , it may exert a strong attractive force on the rest of the islands economic system , including conservation of certain traditional activities , such as agriculture and fishing , and preservation of islands cultural heritage and natural assets .  
To intensify efforts to raise awareness of and to mobilize international and national public opinion concerning the harmful effects of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , including female genital mutilation , in particular through education , the dissemination of information , training , the media and local community meetings , in order to achieve the total elimination of these practices ;  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations and the media in publicity campaigns , with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;

It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .

To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
For that reason , the achievement of international recognition for the sacred , basic and fundamental right of indigenous peoples to own , develop , use , control and occupy their traditional lands and resources was imperative and urgent .  
Efforts towards the eradication of harmful traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , which is a form of violence against women , have received national , regional and international policy support .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
Policy formulation needs to incorporate the experience of local forest users and managers , both traditional and nontraditional , and forest policies need to be better understood , accepted and effectively implemented at the local level .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
Obstacles to achieving equality include restrictive legal and policy norms , harmful traditional , religious and cultural beliefs , and social and economic discrimination .  
The concept of human rights prevailing among the political elite bore the negative imprint of certain traditions ; accordingly , any policy aimed at the promotion of human rights should incorporate some positive traditional values . 
No region in the world and no religion , whether major or minor , traditional or nontraditional , monotheistic or polytheistic , is immune to aggravated discrimination .  
The political and economic transformations of that century had altered the traditional concept of State responsibility , demonstrating that the classical rule of absolute immunity had become outmoded and required reconsideration .

The manipulation of information flows , disinformation and the concealment of information in order to corrupt the psychological and spiritual environment of society , and erode traditional cultural , moral , ethical and aesthetic values ;  
These traditional values have formed a firm foundation which has yielded a prosperous nation with strong family bonds and leadership committed to raising the standard of living for all the nations citizens .

Countries in the region are under pressure of varying degrees of economic strain , political instability , deteriorating social conditions and soaring unemployment , affecting not only the traditional poor , but also the middle classes .  
From the viewpoint of international commercial operators , the question is considered in its traditional private law aspect : evidential rules are of key importance in contractual matters and in the settlement of disputes between commercial parties .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
Urges all Governments to continue contributing to the maintenance of a balance between the licit supply of and demand for opiate raw materials for medical and scientific needs , the achievement of which would be facilitated by maintaining , in so far as their constitutional and legal systems permit , support to the traditional and legal supplier countries , and to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of sources of production of opiate raw materials ;  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;

There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Participants emphasized the importance of traditional and local knowledge and practices to deal with climate variability , and the fact that understanding these and promoting them at the grassroots level constituted an important component in enhancing the adaptive capacity of LDCs to the adverse effects of climate change . 
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Many delegations underscored the primacy of radio as the most used and available traditional medium and expressed widespread support for the pilot project for the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations and the role of the Department in enabling developing nations to meet their information and communications needs .  
While those supporting the Special Rapporteurs proposal were of the view that this required revising the rule itself , most members preferred a middle course whereby the traditional rule would be retained , albeit subject to certain exceptions aimed at those situations where the individual would otherwise have no possibility of obtaining protection by a State .  
Urgyen Trinley Dorje , the seventeenth living Buddha of the Karmapa order , left the Chub monastery in December 1999 with a small group of followers , leaving behind a letter in which he explained that he was going abroad to secure the traditional Black hat and sacred attributes of the living Buddha : In acting thus , I betray neither my country nor my people , nor my monastery nor its great priests . 
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
[ 27 ] Thus , in the absence of a uniform legal framework , voluntary systems are being developed ( discussed below , paras . 52-62 ) which replicate the functions of the traditional bills of lading and are supported by contractual rules binding on the parties . 
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Secondly , he discussed the Programme for Comprehensive Development of Indigenous Communities which had four main components : the financing of economically productive initiatives aimed at raising the standard of living , health services that combined traditional and occidental medicine , intercultural bilingual education aimed at strengthening ancestral culture and , finally , strengthening of indigenous communities and capacity-building of civil servants working with the indigenous population .  
Expressing its satisfaction to national and international non-governmental organizations for the numerous activities they are undertaking in the field to develop the awareness of the populations concerned with a view to the eradication of harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation ,  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
Welcomes the convening by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of an expert meeting to discuss traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination , and takes note of its report , [ 5 ] as a valuable contribution to the process of elaborating a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make more efficient the prevention and punishment of mercenary activities ;  
Welcoming the efforts of the transitional Government of Somalia to promote national reconciliation within Somalia , recognizing that progress has been achieved in some regions in re-establishing economic and administrative stability , and urging the Transitional National Government , political and traditional leaders and factions to make every effort to complete , without preconditions , the peace and reconciliation process through dialogue and involvement of all parties in a spirit of mutual accommodation and tolerance ,  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
The tremendous qualitative difference from traditional forms of advertising is that no nations or individuals can refuse to be exposed to space advertising , which might be considered undesirable for scientific , aesthetic , political , or even religious reasons .  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;  
To eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls , including all forms of violence , harmful traditional or customary practices , including female genital mutilation , the root causes of son preference , marriages without free and full consent of the intending spouses and early marriages , by enacting and enforcing legislation and , where appropriate , formulating comprehensive , multidisciplinary and coordinated national plans , programmes or strategies protecting girls ;  
To eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls , including all forms of violence , harmful traditional or customary practices , including female genital mutilation , the root causes of son preference , marriages without free and full consent of the intending spouses and early marriages , by enacting and enforcing legislation and , where appropriate , formulating comprehensive , multidisciplinary and coordinated national plans , programmes or strategies protecting girls ;  
Pop queen Madonna 's upcoming spiritual tour to Israel to study a mysterious Jewish philosophy has raised questions over her true faith .  Does the self-proclaimed material girl really have faith in the traditional ancient Jewish mysticism or is this simply the latest fashion of self-help for celebrities .  
Wu said China and Ethiopia boast traditional friendship and they have always supported each other , shared common views on many major international and regional issues , and maintained sound consultations and cooperation in international affairs .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
In the coming 5 years , the step of attracting investments should be accelerated ; industry structures , product structures and enterprise structures will be gradually adjusted .  " Three transformations " are to be realized : to immediately develop from single export processing to comprehensive functionality , to transform from a focus on traditional industries into focusing on developing of the new technology industry , and to transform from a focus on scattered , small-scale investment attraction into actively introducing large industry &amp; trade projects from foreign multinational companies and groups .  
At the same time , the Bank of China has also paid attention to bringing all advantages into full play , actively developing the work of marketing ; making the traditional business of international settlement continue to maintain an advantageous position in furious market competition ; and also gained the new development of intermediate services such as foreign exchange settlement and sales , credit cards , agents , substitute charges , etc .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
Its aim is to use Chinese national traditional culture as a link to associate and unite compatriots at home and abroad , to spread national culture , to display the charm of the superior art of the motherland and display the achievements and elegant demeanor of overseas Chinese , Chinese artists in art realms and international cultural exchange .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
Especially in recent years , with continued enhancement of using technology in the weaponry and constant introduction of high new technology , the traditional " men of unusual strength " and " fleet-footed runners " are no longer the tops in training of the missile company .  To replace them are the " software fans " capable of planning and managing commands from the commanding center by softly clicking the mouse in front of the computer screen and the " computer experts " skilled in using software to launch missiles .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
While participating in a discussion held by the Beijing NPC Delegation , Deputy Wu Bangguo , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : It is necessary to use new and high technologies to transform traditional industries and to vigorously develop emerging industries as well as new and high-tech industries so as to advance the readjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
He stated that " in places with deep-rooted traditional cultures , even if it is extremely poor , there is still the setting sun of the tropics and comfort from stable homes that is inspiring , but the poor in the United States do n't even have these , and they often live irregular lives in which even hope has been stripped away . "  ( See Hong Kong " Ming Pao , " 7 December 1994 . )  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Furthermore , all-weather , 24-hour , omnidirectional , highly-dynamic space photography can acquire multifrequency , multiphase , high-resolution space image data rapidly and in a timely manner .  By using this image data and photogrammetry technology , not only is it possible to create traditional paper maps , it is also possible to build digital elevation models , produce digital orthographic projection maps and digital topographical maps , satisfying the need to support long-range weapons , cruise missiles , and other such precision guided weapons .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
Both the traditional enemies and long-standing allies of the United States heaved a sigh as if relieved of a heavy load , praising the US president for deciding to shelve the NMD program and leave his successor to decide whether or not to deploy the system , which is regarded as a threat to the global arms balance , and saying that the president has made a wise decision which will avoid upsetting the global balance of power .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
In the course of economic development , we have long been accustomed to the traditional model of economic growth , so that the situation of blind investment , redundant construction , " large and all-embracing " , and " small and self-contained " was very serious , and many industries had enormous excess production capacity .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
The first contradiction is that some groups and individuals may exploit their resource advantages , previously acquired under the traditional system , to pursue gains under market conditions , thereby forming exclusive , speculative , and closed benefit-distribution groups whose resource-monopoly capability will undermine a balanced interest-differentiation process based on the normal development of the market economy .  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .  
We are willing to make joint efforts with Vietnamese comrades to develop better the relations between the two parties on the basis of independence , absolute equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in each other 's internal affairs ; smoothly promote the two countries ' traditional friendly cooperative relations to a higher level ; and blaze a more beautiful future for the two countries ' relations in the 21st century .  
The Chinese Government and people treasure very much the traditional friendship between China and Laos , and are willing to join the Lao side in conscientiously implementing the " Joint Statement " on bilateral cooperation and in actively deepening and developing the long-term , stable , good neighborly and friendly relations of mutual trust and comprehensive cooperation between China and Laos in the new century .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that China and Syria are both developing countries ; the Chinese Government values its traditional friendship with Syria and appreciates and thanks the Syrian Government for its enduring valuable support for China on the Taiwan and human rights issues ; it is ready to continue to maintain and strengthen coordination and cooperation with Syria in all fields in the new century , and raise to a new level the enduringly stable bilateral relationship of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation .  
Even though in the case of a joint combat battlefield centering around ground forces the traditional one-dimensional support model for covering the entire in-depth battlefield may still ensure combat needs , with the unprecedented rapid development of multidimensional space in the joint combat battlefields of the future , only through the comprehensive utilization of a variety of support methods in multidimensional space will it be possible to ensure the demand of combat operations for logistical support .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
Third , the implementation of the strategy for relying on science and education in national development and the adoption of relevant favorable policies will encourage overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin to make investment in running high-tech and new technology enterprises or transforming the traditional industries with high and new technologies .  This will also provide great opportunities for scientists and technology experts among overseas Chinese and the high-tech enterprises run by them to bring their strong points into better play .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
At the same time , the treaty is imbued with the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally acknowledged norms of international law , and makes a contribution to traditional international legal principles that history has proven effective , such as national sovereignty , equality between states , and noninterference in internal affairs .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
Since , however , Britain has consistently been a loyal follower of US foreign policy , and has consistently acted as an irreplaceable bridge between the United States and Europe , given the marked decline in its national strength , if Britain wants to maintain its great power status and continue to have major influence in the international arena , it will do everything possible to avoid damaging its traditional special relationship with the United States on account of the differences between them .  
Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .  The potential for higher labor productivity driven by technological revolution will not be reversed .  This is why the performance of the " Dow Jones index , " dominated by traditional industries , betters that of the " Nasdaq index . "  
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation demanded that increasing export by every possible means should be regarded as a top priority in the development of China 's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the second half of this year , and that it is necessary to promote the export of mechanical and electrical products , textiles , and other traditional staple commodities and the export of new hi-tech products and agricultural products , and give impetus to export by major exporters and foreign-invested enterprises .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
In view of this , we should select a number of key areas , such as equipment manufacturing , the deep-processing of farm products , clean coal , and the comprehensive utilization of resources ; speed up the development of common technologies , key technologies , and supporting technologies that can give an impetus to structural upgrading ; and accelerate the technical upgrading of traditional industries .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
During the current visit , the NAV delegation has specially studied China 's construction of the Three Gorges Project and held discussions and exchanged views with the NPC financial and economic committee , the State Council 's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee , the Ministry of Water Resources and the Power Corporation . We are willing to carry out active exchanges and cooperation with our Vietnamese comrades in economic construction and to further and constantly enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .

Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily .

Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge .

Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic .

Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season .

Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back .

Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
For example , hsiang-chu singing copies after Peking Opera , with the tone high pitched and clear , using falsetto , with the same styles for the leading man and leading lady . The gestures and choreography are also more pronounced and defined . The music is performed according to fixed charts , which is quite different from the traditional Taiwanese ko-tzai-hsi where " the teacher gives the root , the actors improvise the branches " - - the actors on the stage and the musicians backstage play off and coor-dinate with each other .  
Country feeling in the city : At the 1990 Taipei Lantern Festival sponsored by the Tourism Bureau , the sculptor Yang Ying-feng used science and technology to add to the festive atmosphere by creating a giant stainless steel dragon that featured music , dry ice and a changing laser light show . The traditional lanterns at Lung Shan Temple in the city 's Wanhua district likewise attracted thousands of visitors .  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Candidate , candidate . . . , incompetent , incompetent . . . , fall off the horse when you try to ride . . . . " From its origins as a game in which children rode on a stick horse , the puma troupe has gone from the traditional imperial examination candidate riding a red horse following a deity around to today 's riding of a white horse being sent along with the deceased to ride the clouds . This extreme development of riding with abandon through heaven and hell is a major transformation in yi-chen .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
Professor Yang Ling-ling of the Taipei Medical College points out that Chinese are in the habit of taking composite medications rather carelessly In particular there are many so-called " informal recipes " for Chinese traditional remedies that include diuretic ingredients which are potentially toxic . Diuretics can create a false impression of increased urine flow , which can make uremia sufferers careless , when in fact they may be extending the illness and even worsening the damage to the kidneys . "  
Besides the merely religious activities of praying for good fortune , the temple has celebrations linked to the season . From Chinese New Year 's to the Sea Goddess ' birthday in March , there is a continuous stream of activities , including classical dances to welcome the God of Happiness and ceremonies welcoming Matsu as well as such traditional farming and fishing activities as the dying of fish nets , chanting to count fish fry , walking the water wheel , grabbing chickens and floating on bamboo rafts to grab ducks .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
Today , succeeding to traditional tea houses , with modern beverage and packaging technology , it has finally broken through the traditional image of " old man tea " - of elderly gents sipping delicate little cups of hot tea - to display a startling potential for rebirth .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
But with Taiwan 's soaring property prices and the headlong rush of urban development , can these old town houses , draped over Tanshui 's undulating topography on the traditional long rectangular plots so typical of this province , survive ? Some say yes , some no ; as yet we can not be sure .  
If you want to understand traditional Yami culture , you have to get back to the tribal village . Only through such everyday experiences as building Yami boats and going out at night to catch flying fish will one come to an intuitive understanding of the deep meaning behind related legends , taboos and customs . ( photo by Cheng Yuan-ching )  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men . Not even a TV series which exalts the most legendary female figure in Chinese history can escape the confines of maleoriented thinking .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
Choose any public structure in the Po Ai Special District ( the high-security area which includes the offices of top government officials ) and you may be surprised to discover that this structure has , at one and the same time , pillars and gables in the traditional Italian style , an exaggerated French Mansard style roof , and red brick walls made with decorative white stripes typical of Britain 's Victorian era .  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
The magic is in the detailChen has travelled all over Taiwan and southern Fujian looking at traditional buildings , but his favorite is Chaihsing Villa in Tantsu Rural Township , Taichung County . Its carved wood , chiachishao ( decorative lead-glaze ceramics ) and carved brick-clay tiles are all superb .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
The most marked characteristic of traditional Bunun garb is the pocket-like pouch worn at the chest by Bunun men , called a kulin . Men 's clothes feature colored patterns on a white background , with the main patterns being on the back , whereas women 's clothes are mainly black . According to custom , Bunun women can not wear brightly colored clothing because of their " original sin . "  
There is greater flexibility in the forward progress of the experimental classes . Teachers can design instructional activities to meet the needs of the curriculum . For example , in the Chinese language class on " Kung Jung Takes the Smallest Pear , " the teacher got the kids to put on a little drama . For a third year lesson in the standardized texts on the aboriginal " Harvest Festival , " the Tatun Primary School invited the Formosan Aboriginal Dance Troupe to perform traditional indigenous song and dance at the school .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Community chief Tseng Chen-chuan describes how in the past , when village elders were happily drunk , they would sing a traditional ballad recounting tribal history , the gist of which was : " Our ancestors were born from the rocks , and came here from their place of origin on the other side of Tapachien Mountain . Ssumakussu was the first place they made home on the north side of the mountain , and when the population of the tribe increased they branched out to Hsiuluan , Tienpu , Hsinkuang and elsewhere . "  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Lin undertook a simple ritual gesture designed to break the spell ( he placed some water in a bowl and upended it on a small table under the traditional " double joy " character suspended on the wall ) , and everything was fine .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
The first time that I had written and delivered a speech in Mandarin . The first time that I had attended a Christian church service conducted entirely in Mandarin . The first time that I had celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Taoyuan complete with hot pot ( huo guo ) , sticky rice cake ( nian gao ) , and a lucky red envelope ( hong bao ) . The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
One of his own specialties is a " galan-tine , " in which many strips of meat are bound together into a long loaf . To stew the meat , instead of the traditional sachet of strong spices , Kao only uses a few pods of star anise and a dash of Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper . To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
Another traditional veggie offering is the " Arhat Dish " ( arhats are disciples of Buddha ) , which is made up of a number of ingredients blended together . These may include sliced mushroom , miniature corn , carrots , gingko and gingko nuts , lily bulbs , or facai seaweed . These are fried up separately , then combined and cooked again evenly , and seasoned .  
Yet , Kan emphasizes , not all men are " genderblind . " Many men are willing to imagine themselves in the woman 's shoes . Moreover , not all women have an inborn " feminist consciousness . " Take for example many women who come from affluent families or who have been very successful and have a vested interest in this male-dominated society ; or look at women from traditional backgrounds who have long accepted as fate that " males are to be respected and women despised " and who have never dared voice any doubts .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
Even though the hunting way of life practiced by the aboriginal people for centuries is being turned into an economic resource , it need not-and should not-be merely a superficial tourist attraction . Of course the hunting plan can not solve all existing problems , but , says Sasala , aboriginal people do n't always want to be complaining and asking for government help . Nor should they be intimidated by existing laws into readily giving up their traditional way of life . The hunting plan is actually a movement on behalf of all of aboriginal society .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] . The almanac showed outstanding calculating capability , being comparable to the official version , published shortly after Hong 's , in defining the traditional 24 " solar periods " ( climatic stages of the year ) . Hong 's work was very well-received .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
The way this mainland wife was accepted by a traditional Taiwanese clan and has become chairperson of the management committee of their ancestral home , can be attributed not only to her seniority , unbending principles and utter selflessness , but also to her matchless warmhearted enthusiasm and indomitable fighting spirit .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
In 1997 , after the new curricula for elementary schools had been fully implemented , Chung Ching , an assistant professor of math education at National Taipei Teachers ' College wrote in a report he made on " The Transformation of the Culture of Math Class in the Lower Grades " that those students who have been educated under the new curricula are much more " able to voice their opinions , ask questions , work with others and learn from others ' way of thinking " than earlier students who had received traditional educations .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
This is especially significant in view of the wholesale destruction of traditional buildings in mainland China over recent years . In Taiwan too , tall office buildings and concrete apartment blocks have become the main architectural " vocabulary , " leaving no space for stone lions , and the stone lions at temples are often smeared in gaudy colors , making them unbearably vulgar .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life . It appears in the traditional Chinese list of " essential items " for the kitchen , right up there with rice , soy sauce , oil , firewood , salt and vinegar . The late Lin Yutang described it as " a widespread custom that has added much color to everyday life of the people . "  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
In an ordinary class there are too many students to do any activities , and you 're stuck with traditional teaching methods . In order to keep things moving along , it is n't possible to look after the needs of students who fall behind . But in the experimental class , students are divided into four groups according to ability , with no more than eight students in each group . Every student has a chance to speak , and students of different abilities can be brought along at their own pace , and not abandoned .  
Lee has been steeped all his life in traditional Chinese morality , and has always sought to inject his personal ideas into his movies , " teaching a moral lesson in a fun way , " as the old Chinese saying goes . Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
As Hong Liren continues to reminisce , sometimes wistfully and sometimes with excitement , the afternoon passes by and evening approaches . With the sun still shining brightly into the studio , musicians begin to drift in . To either side the players of the pipa ( a plucked string instrument , similar to the ancient Chinese lute ) , sanxian ( a three-stringed plucked instrument ) , dongxiao ( a vertical bamboo flute ) and erxian ( a two-stringed bowed instrument ) are seated on traditional wooden armchairs .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . G-Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time . He is very fearful of failing to record tribal elders before they die , thereby losing a precious part of the tribal cultural heritage .  
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits . Critic Wang Chia-chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "  
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .  
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time-honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth . Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers . The three-legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
They express their opinions and get to know each other . The online authors that publishing companies are focusing on are but a tiny fraction of the online population . What is more , even a cursory search of the Web will bring up hundreds of websites devoted to online literature . The body of literature represented therein is both vast and varied in format , and only a tiny bit of it can be reflected in the output of traditional publishers .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Every traditional culture in the world has magic amulets ( geometric shapes , bones , insects or animals ) that bring good luck , ward off evil , or affect the physical or mental condition of other people , or that even , with the appropriate incantations , put you online to the supernatural world .  
The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Wu Cheng-chun , general manager of the LungYen Group , explains that his company 's funeral service is organized around a simple system , in contrast to the convoluted requirements of a traditional funeral . All the essential rites are included , but not the various bizarre and superfluous additions that are often seen .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
The first leg of reform ( " changing opera " ) included a ban on traditional operatic works that dealt in any way with frightening murders , superstitious beliefs in ghosts or spirits , or sexually risque subject matter .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Chu Ge noted that he strongly encouraged Lee to use the traditional Chinese medium of ink , because ink by nature is best suited to express abstract ideas . Lee , having never before painted a traditional ink painting , has proved even more capable than most of transcending concrete forms to let the ink freely play out in a way that characterizes his most recent series of compositions , " Language of Ink . "  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
The Danaiku Ecological Park was established in 1995 , and in 1996 its revenues totaled only NT $ 839,000 . The following year they more than doubled to nearly NT $ 2 million . This rapid growth continued in the years that followed , and the figure topped NT $ 10 million in 2001 . Currently there are nearly 80 village residents employed there as guides , plant tenders or sellers of souvenirs , traditional Tsou food or barbecued meat .  
When Kao was a youngster he dreamed of running like Pasuya , a figure in Tsou myth that could run as fast as a sparrow flies . Kao had learned the story from his father . " I worshipped my father , who had received traditional tribal training as a hunter ! "  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
Ho Chun-jui , head of the Center for the Study of Sexualities at National Central University , analyzes the movie in terms of time , place and people thus : The gradual legitimization of homosexuality in Taiwanese culture has lessened the taboo against Lan Yu ; the two cool male protaganists not only show passion and warmth , but also pointedly express intimate tenderness , a breakthrough in the portrayal of the traditional male lead ; and the contradiction between love vs class background and tradition-told without leaving the parameters of a love story-all naturally please the audience .  
Kwan is talented at conveying the role of the tormented but strong-willed female in traditional society . Considered as particularly skilled at smashing the stereotyped female image as portrayed in cinema , he possesses a strong sense of feminism .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
Tunghai University 's architecture team , the group responsible for the design , after discussing with structural engineers utilized a " sandwich " technique to build the walls . The walls ' outward appearance preserves tradition in its use of stone slabs from 40 to 50 centimeters thick . However , the interior of the walls is made of steel-reinforced concrete , allowing them to satisfy structural safety requirements in addition to displaying traditional features .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
When you visit Kinmen , everywhere you can see old villages with their houses neatly lined up on a north-south axis . Civilian residences preserving traditional Fujianese architecture form tight little knots . Red tiles , stone walls , and elegant " swallow-tail " roof ridges bounce sunlight off the fresh green fields , creating a leisurely ambience of small-island warmth and security .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
Natives of Hsiyu living on the main island of Taiwan and elsewhere are now starting to move back , attracted by the outstanding traditional homes , friendly atmosphere , big expanse of azure skies , and pristine blue sea .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
In the early evening hours on the annual Lantern Festival , the residents of Erhkan Village light up long strings of red lanterns and feast on all sorts of traditional Lantern Festival treats , such as chicken noodle soup in an herbal medicine broth , steamed pumpkin dumplings , slices of cobia sashimi , peanut candy , and deep-fried jujubes .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
In 1992 , an international conference of members of the World Heritage Convention held in Japan produced the " Nara Document on Authenticity . " This declared that Japan 's maintenance and replacement of wooden structures help preserve traditional skills , so that the previous definition of authenticity was expanded to include " reliability of the sources of relevant information . "  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
His boss 's faith in his talents proved well founded , as Huang quickly injected wonderful creative touches to the small traditional ornaments that he carved . The proportions , expressions , and poses of his rendered subjects were always accurate , detailed , and lively , and never fell into the typical ruts . As a result , his boss began to let him design new products . Huang began to acquire a small reputation within the industry .  
Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
In the sixth lunar month , traditional music and theater troupes from across Taiwan make their festive way through an outdoor market in Lukang with " birthday noodles " and " birthday peaches , " screeching away on their high-pitched suona ( a traditional Chinese wind instrument ) and beating on gongs and drums as they head toward Yuchu Temple , located in the middle of an old outdoor market . They come here to pay their respects to Marshal Tiandu , honored by many thespians in Taiwan as their patron god .  
In the visual media kingdom of the US , in the past few years revenue from productions that include animation and digital special effects has exceeded that from films shot frame by frame on celluloid in the traditional manner , and in Japan , computer games outstrip the automobile industry in sales value , showing remarkable popularity despite the stagnant economy .  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
Recently , various large hospitals have bowed to popular trends and are providing traditional therapeutic massage as an immensely successful " sideline . " Does this perhaps reflect an urgent need for stress-free tender loving care ?  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
A returnee to Taiwan after 20 years in Spain , where she rose to international fame as a flamenco dancer , Flor de Loto sports a deep tan and gregarious personality . There is a flamboyance about her , but not an intimidating sort . On the contrary , she has a way of putting absolutely everyone at ease , as if she were the nice lady next door . With ease and grace , she manages to combine the hearty , unrestrained spirit of the Spaniards with the traditional virtues of the Chinese .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
But " back when traditional filial piety was the only model for intergenerational relations , there were also many problems , " argues Chuang Hui-chiu . In the past , everyone held an idealized version of home . When social change exposed problems to the light of day , people started talking about them . This discussion is healthy .  
Yeh Kuang-hui , an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , has researched traditional Chinese conceptions of filial piety . He points out that the result of such social precepts as " parents can do no wrong " and " there are three major offenses against filial piety , and the gravest of all is not producing an heir " is an autocratic family . It offers a kind of " absolute " or compulsory filial piety that no longer holds water .  
Yeh points out that ever since the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , the traditional principle of filial piety was deemed to be dogmatism . The principle of filial piety was connected to loyalty to the emperor and was thus authoritarian . In modern society , everybody is an independent individual , and so today we talk about relative filial piety .  
Yu Xiulian 's suspicions that Yu Jiaolong is the individual responsible for the sword 's theft strain her friendship with the younger woman , as well as dragging Li and Jade Fox into bloody conflict . Crouching Tiger leads audiences on a ride through the panoply of Chinese scenery , from endless stretches of barren desert to misty mountain landscapes to verdant bamboo forests to cascading waterfalls to traditional courtyards .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
This year marked a special innovation for Pinghsi 's Sky Lantern Festival , as Western Valentine 's Day fell between the Lord of Heaven celebration on the ninth day of the first lunar month and the traditional Lantern Festival on the fifteenth . Pinghsi expanded its Sky Lantern Festival into a carnival embracing all three .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
Apart from raising tinsmithing to the realm of art , he has been constantly tinkering , improving the properties of tin to make it stronger and harder , to allow it to keep its luster longer , and to give it a silky feel . He has also employed traditional casting , cold forging and detailed carving to expand its expressive abilities .  
Clad in bright red traditional aboriginal garb , the Piyahaw 's Piyahaw Dance Troupe danced energetically to a song by aboriginal singer Wan Sha-lang , their gestures expansive and full of confidence , looking for all the world as if they had many years of dancing experience under their belts . " When we were just starting out , we had stage fright , " admits Wang Shu-min , the troupe leader . But now , little more than a year later , they have already played at many performance spaces and are very relaxed when they perform .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs . After grasping the unique qualities of eggs , he pushed his skill to a new level by nesting a set of eight different sized eggs each within the other resulting in what looked like the traditional multi-layered balls carved from elephant ivory . He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Wu Tsai-chu was born in Miaoli in 1938 into a family that was wealthy but also extremely strict . Although her father Wu A-tsai was a businessman , he was also a firm believer in the traditional code of behavior and ethics . He had a total of nine children and inflicted corporal punishment for any behavior that displeased him .  
The folk totems in the painstakingly executed works of potter Li Hsing-lung rearrange traditional linear patterns , transforming them into symbols , resulting in entirely new creations uniquely representative of the culture from which they sprang . Bearing gold , red , blue , and indigo colors typical of Eastern art , Li 's works are redolent of the Orient , and of Taiwan in particular .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
His objective was to achieve a new kind of texture and break with the norms of traditional lacquered pottery . Artists before Li simply took pottery as the base for the lacquer , while Li sought to preserve the linear patterns and texture of pottery along with the " layered light " effect of lacquer right on the surface of the finished work , thereby adding to its visual impact and achieving a melding of these two millennia-old art forms and blazing a new trail in the arts .  
The eldest grandson of Chang Wei-ting , the European representative of the ROC Tourism Bureau , was especially noteworthy for his personification of the traditional Chinese virtues of hard work and patience . He continued to practice , despite blisters , cuts , and torn skin , achieving amazing results in six days , and his skillful demonstration of the staff won resounding applause .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
A sound recycling regime is extremely important . " Chen gives an example : Taiwan 's paper recycling is quite successful , because traditional paper recycling businesses have existed for 30 or 40 years . They have not been displaced by societal changes , and have been fortunate to have their efforts be in lockstep with the new era of resource recycling . A virtuous circle has been created , not only making for an outstanding record with recycling , but also seeing vendors evolve from the use of street stalls to the construction of numerous recycling plants .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Wu had made separate molds for the orchids ' centers and five petals , so he invited an expert in " running water " welding to put them together . After six hours , the petals were only halfway assembled . The expert said that he really thought they should use traditional welding flux , but Wu Ching was determined and refused . After the expert left , Wu worked and studied for five hours before finally finishing one orchid .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
The redbrick building was in traditional Hokkien style , and the light reflecting off the lake set the whole scene off . The lake was surrounded on all sides by smaller ponds full of aquatic plants ; grasses of different heights , lotuses swaying gently-a wonderfully relaxing scene , like something from another world .  
Holes were patched with pieces of broken tile , a mixture of lime and sand was applied as a base , and then a layer made up of a mixture of brown sugar and lime was applied over it . The terrazo and tile floors of the interior and the halls were completely changed out and replaced with traditional unglazed tiles .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
The pavilion on the hill features a carved wood panel ceiling with reliefs of peonies , peaches , plums , orchids , and chrysanthemums . Folding screens and scrolls feature impressive calligraphy . Best of all are several pairs of rhyming couplets around the garden , which were written specifically for their locations . The calligraphy , by an elder Chinese-Australian man , is exquisite , and their wording is steeped in traditional Chinese culture .

he said that chinese president jiang zemin held a fruitful meeting with president leghari this morning , and said that he was also pleased to meet president leghari and believed that the pakistani president 's visit would further strengthen the existing traditional friendship between the two countries  
A high degree of understanding at the level of leadership and the traditional mutual respect of our peoples has established a lasting basis for the development of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitable bases .  
Is it a crisis of identity inherent in modern societies ; a loss of traditional values and taboos ; a flight from a future darkened by economic crises and constant social change ?  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .  
It stated that a people 's democracy would be built in the political , social , economic and cultural spheres that took account of traditional structures and aimed at a subsequent transition to socialism .  
Since complex emergencies could not be addressed through traditional peacekeeping efforts alone , they required a comprehensive approach and sustained efforts by the States concerned , as well as assistance through regional arrangements and organizations .  
The application of the widely advocated concept of good governance with less emphasis on traditional donor assistance is not impartial : it is very flexible and indulgent when it comes to countries with strategic raw materials , but strict and restrictive when it comes to others .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts . 
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
To form an acceptable transitional government , which could , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
Ms . AYKOR , referring to the special temporary measures outlined in paragraph 90 of the report , made the general observation that despite those measures of positive discrimination , the status of individual women continued to be determined by traditional and cultural attitudes .  
Protecting the [ traditional ] rights to land and other resources of pastoralists , fishery workers and nomadic and indigenous people and strengthening land management in areas of pastoral or nomadic activity , building on traditional communal practices , controlling encroachment by others , and developing improved systems of range management and access to water , markets , credit , animal production , veterinary services , health including health services , education and information ;  
Mindful of the need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
Another programme that previously focused on small-scale , on-farm efforts in the use and conservation of water and soil resources and on traditional dryland crops has recently expanded to also cover off-farm common property resources and the development of viable alternative livelihood systems in marginal rural areas .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations . 
Non-recurrent publications . ( i ) Composite study of cultural and traditional practices that are harmful to the girl-child ; ( ii ) manual for gender training ; ( iii ) indicators for gender-responsive policies , plans , programmes and activities ; ( iv ) manual for legal literacy training . ( a ) Advisory services .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .  
The task of transforming disaster into constructive development requires a conceptual model different from the traditional , linear model of economic development which assumes a stable administrative system .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
The Colloquium took place in agreeable , secluded surroundings which provided an atmosphere conducive to an informal and frank exchange of ideas and experience , further enhanced by unanimous agreement that the Colloquium would depart from the traditional format of United Nations system meetings and eschew the presentation of formal views of individual organizations .  The participants would not present the papers they had prepared , which would serve simply as background documents .  
They are , inter alia , rights to equality of treatment and non-discrimination ; such cultural rights as the right to use indigenous languages , to use indigenous dress and to practise indigenous forms of spirituality ; such civil and political rights as the rights to practise traditional indigenous forms of social organization ; and such economic and social rights as the right to hold land under traditional forms of tenure .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
While the term " living resources " in the Convention might be broad enough to include free living and symbiotic micro-organisms , the collection and subsequent use of microbial genetic resources is not necessarily analogous to traditional methods of harvesting marine living resources .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .

To form an acceptable transitional Government , which could , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections were established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help to establish those conditions .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ; 
several requests for 1995 intakes were received from our traditional co-sponsoring partners , such as the Institute for International Education and others , these represented a small number of many of the worthy proposals both inside South Africa and abroad that could not be given proper consideration in the absence of recommendations on the Programme 's future .  
To form an acceptable transitional government , which could , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
To form an acceptable transitional government , which could , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
is anticipated that the Council would negotiate and oversee an immediate and durable cease-fire ; create and control a national security force to provide for security throughout the country and oversee the collection and safeguarding of all heavy weapons in the country ; and form an acceptable transitional government , which would , inter alia , control the national security force , until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions .

of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
Information , education and communication strategies that employ a multi-channel approach have proved effective , since information can be disseminated through various channels , traditional and modern , and can be packaged in various forms so as to allow both literate and illiterate audiences to understand key messages .  
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .

That gesture had a double symbolism , as it expressed the traditional friendship between the Cyprus and Palestinian peoples and constituted a concrete manifestation of the progress in the peace process and of the need for substantial steps to improve the standard of living of the Palestinian people .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
To form an acceptable transitional government which could , inter alia , control the national security force until conditions for free and fair elections are established throughout the country , possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures , such as a grand assembly , to help establish those conditions ;  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Provide accessible , affordable , impartial , prompt and humane local systems of justice by , inter alia , facilitating and strengthening , where appropriate , existing traditional institutions and procedures for the resolution of disputes and conflicts ; ( e bis . )  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
The control of water use in irrigated agriculture can be addressed in various ways , such as levying penalties for water use in excess of water requirements projected for the next growing season , or by promoting the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems to replace the traditional techniques , for example , by making available low-interest loans contingent on the purchase and installation of improved irrigation equipment . 
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
The ECLAC Staff Association is active in a wide variety of issues , ranging from the traditional staff representation activities to support of charitable activities , sports and cultural activities as well as ongoing staff welfare and social functions .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The family unit in India was very strong and provided the social security net for vulnerable family members ; however , the traditional extended or joint family was increasingly being eroded because of the strains of modern life . 
Three aspects were especially relevant : to adapt the institution of the family to modern times while preserving the stabilizing functions of the traditional family ; to emancipate women from traditionally defined roles to enable them to participate as equal partners in public life ; and to control population growth , which was related both to gender justice and to the imperatives of economic development .  
In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
According to the governmental delegates , the State and its legislation , while recognizing the dominant , but not overwhelming , role of the Orthodox Church , which represents the religion of the majority of the population for historical , national and traditional reasons , are said to provide a climate of religious freedom , notwithstanding isolated cases of intolerance or discrimination , in particular in the administration .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
His delegation shared the concern about the dire financial crisis faced by UNRWA and was gratified to note that UNRWA was considering a number of innovative approaches to expand its traditional donor base .  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
The Panel , while considering the merits of the application of bottom-up approaches along with top-down approaches , involving all major groups concerned with the issues , emphasized the need for national action programmes to draw more extensively on local and traditional knowledge and agro-sylvopastoral systems , in accordance with guiding principles as outlined in programme element I . 3 . 
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .  To this end , we express strong support for the steps taken by the Court to take advantage of the benefits provided by the electronic media , such as the Internet , and in particular the construction of its own website , which should facilitate public access to the Court 's voluminous documents .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
The work of UNED-UK / United Nations Environment and Development-United Kingdom Committee and Peoples ' Forum 2001 in Japan have been recognized by other non-governmental organizations and international organizations . 18 National networks , if supported and strengthened , have the potential to be the best-placed mechanisms for follow-up to international conferences . 19 Support for national network non-governmental organizations is particularly important in the next phase of Agenda 21 follow-up , in which international conferences , which have been the traditional mobilizing factor for national networks , will be largely missing . 
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Such measures would promote change in persisting negative attitudes towards children , particularly girls , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , and contribute to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health and well-being of children , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
It was highlighted that education , technical training and lifelong learning were integral parts on a continuum , implying that knowledge and skills acquired in formal as well as non-formal , out-of-school education , community activities and traditional knowledge are valued and recognized . 
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
The Platform for Action defines violence against women as including Physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , including battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry _ related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non _ spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ( para .  113 ) .  
The Committee will continue to receive information relating to traditional practices , particularly in the light of its revised guidelines for reports which require States parties , in preparing their initial and subsequent reports under the articles of the Convention or in supplementary oral and / or written materials supplied in connection with reports already submitted , to take account of the 12 critical areas of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .

It was reported that , unlike traditional publicly funded projects , in which the Government was responsible for the entire implementation of the project , including for obtaining financing and guaranteeing its repayment , in the case of privately financed infrastructure projects the Government engaged a private entity to develop , maintain and operate an infrastructure facility in exchange for the right to charge a price , either to the public or to the Government , for the use of the facility or the services or goods it generated .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of peace and security , this paramount international body must be equipped and strengthened to do more in framing international treaties and standards and in encouraging international norms and practices that will bring about equitable economic development and social justice for all peoples .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .

A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .

Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .  
Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .

With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .

Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices .

Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women .

It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
The statement indicated that female genital mutilation was considered by a number of societies to be an initiation rite which allowed the girl child to integrate into the community and stressed the importance of training , information and education as effective means to combat harmful traditional practices and noted that judicial decisions should be a last recourse in that context .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .

For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .

Although the dug-out dwellings were not designed as permanent residences and required repair in certain aspects , the preference of the residents to remain in their traditional dwellings near their grazing lands provides a cautionary example of the need not to assume that more sophisticated , not to mention more expensive , structures will necessarily correspond to the needs and preferences of the intended beneficiaries .  
This would include ( i ) documentation of traditional ethnobiological knowledge , including identification of ecosystems , species and genetic types that are endangered or in short supply at the community level ; ( ii ) factors responsible for their endangerment , and actions that can be taken to address the situation ; and ( iii ) identification of knowledgeable persons who should be formally recognized and made integral participants in biodiversity conservation at the national and local levels .

The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
Obstacles to achieving equality include restrictive legal and policy norms , harmful traditional , religious and cultural beliefs , and social and economic discrimination .  
The concept of human rights prevailing among the political elite bore the negative imprint of certain traditions ; accordingly , any policy aimed at the promotion of human rights should incorporate some positive traditional values . 
No region in the world and no religion , whether major or minor , traditional or nontraditional , monotheistic or polytheistic , is immune to aggravated discrimination .  
The political and economic transformations of that century had altered the traditional concept of State responsibility , demonstrating that the classical rule of absolute immunity had become outmoded and required reconsideration .  
Efforts towards the eradication of harmful traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , which is a form of violence against women , has received national , regional and international policy support .  
Efforts towards the eradication of harmful traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , which is a form of violence against women , has received national , regional and international policy support .  
This instrument recognizes the right to an adequate standard of living , social security , the right to work and just and favourable conditions of work , and the right to education , in addition to traditional civil and political rights .  
Efforts towards the eradication of harmful traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , which is a form of violence against women , have received national , regional and international policy support .  
This taboo has now been shattered and it is with extreme satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur notes the growing commitment of civil society in countries affected by harmful traditional practices , especially female genital mutilation .  
The manipulation of information flows , disinformation and the concealment of information in order to corrupt the psychological and spiritual environment of society , and erode traditional cultural , moral , ethical and aesthetic values ;  
These traditional values have formed a firm foundation which has yielded a prosperous nation with strong family bonds and leadership committed to raising the standard of living for all the nations citizens .  
He is reported to have stated that traditional cultural values and moderation were sufficient measures , and to have dismissed the idea of an AIDS pandemic as politically motivated dissident propaganda .  
But over and above traditional legal aid , which is generally limited to criminal matters , the expert emphasized the need to help rural people to use common law as an instrument to improve their rights situation .  
Countries in the region are under pressure of varying degrees of economic strain , political instability , deteriorating social conditions and soaring unemployment , affecting not only the traditional poor , but also the middle classes .  
From the viewpoint of international commercial operators , the question is considered in its traditional private law aspect : evidential rules are of key importance in contractual matters and in the settlement of disputes between commercial parties .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
Urges all Governments to continue contributing to the maintenance of a balance between the licit supply of and demand for opiate raw materials for medical and scientific needs , the achievement of which would be facilitated by maintaining , in so far as their constitutional and legal systems permit , support to the traditional and legal supplier countries , and to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of sources of production of opiate raw materials ;  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female infanticide , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Participants emphasized the importance of traditional and local knowledge and practices to deal with climate variability , and the fact that understanding these and promoting them at the grassroots level constituted an important component in enhancing the adaptive capacity of LDCs to the adverse effects of climate change . 
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Many delegations underscored the primacy of radio as the most used and available traditional medium and expressed widespread support for the pilot project for the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations and the role of the Department in enabling developing nations to meet their information and communications needs .  
While those supporting the Special Rapporteurs proposal were of the view that this required revising the rule itself , most members preferred a middle course whereby the traditional rule would be retained , albeit subject to certain exceptions aimed at those situations where the individual would otherwise have no possibility of obtaining protection by a State .  
Urgyen Trinley Dorje , the seventeenth living Buddha of the Karmapa order , left the Chub monastery in December 1999 with a small group of followers , leaving behind a letter in which he explained that he was going abroad to secure the traditional Black hat and sacred attributes of the living Buddha : In acting thus , I betray neither my country nor my people , nor my monastery nor its great priests . 
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
[ 27 ] Thus , in the absence of a uniform legal framework , voluntary systems are being developed ( discussed below , paras . 52-62 ) which replicate the functions of the traditional bills of lading and are supported by contractual rules binding on the parties . 
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Secondly , he discussed the Programme for Comprehensive Development of Indigenous Communities which had four main components : the financing of economically productive initiatives aimed at raising the standard of living , health services that combined traditional and occidental medicine , intercultural bilingual education aimed at strengthening ancestral culture and , finally , strengthening of indigenous communities and capacity-building of civil servants working with the indigenous population .  
Expressing its satisfaction to national and international non-governmental organizations for the numerous activities they are undertaking in the field to develop the awareness of the populations concerned with a view to the eradication of harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation ,  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
Welcomes the convening by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of an expert meeting to discuss traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination , and takes note of its report , [ 5 ] as a valuable contribution to the process of elaborating a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make more efficient the prevention and punishment of mercenary activities ;  
Welcoming the efforts of the transitional Government of Somalia to promote national reconciliation within Somalia , recognizing that progress has been achieved in some regions in re-establishing economic and administrative stability , and urging the Transitional National Government , political and traditional leaders and factions to make every effort to complete , without preconditions , the peace and reconciliation process through dialogue and involvement of all parties in a spirit of mutual accommodation and tolerance ,  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
The tremendous qualitative difference from traditional forms of advertising is that no nations or individuals can refuse to be exposed to space advertising , which might be considered undesirable for scientific , aesthetic , political , or even religious reasons .  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;  
To eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls , including all forms of violence , harmful traditional or customary practices , including female genital mutilation , the root causes of son preference , marriages without free and full consent of the intending spouses and early marriages , by enacting and enforcing legislation and , where appropriate , formulating comprehensive , multidisciplinary and coordinated national plans , programmes or strategies protecting girls ;
